NATURE PHOTONICS  VOL 5  JULY 2011  www.nature.comnaturephotonics 397Diamond photonics Igor Aharonovich1 Andrew D. Greentree and Steven Prawer Diamond a material marvelled for its strength beauty and perfection was rst used to polish stone axes in Neolithic times. This most ancient of materials is now being touted by many as the ideal platform for quantumage technologies. In this Review we describe how the properties of diamond match the requirements of the second quantum revolution. We also discuss recent progress in the development of diamond  and particularly diamond colour centres  for transforming quantum information science into practical quantum information technology. Silicon and silica are the two most important materials for modern information and communication technology. Silicon chips power our computers silica fibres transmit signals and silicon photonics provides integrated optical solutions. It may seem strange therefore to discuss a radical departure from siliconbased platforms that is potentially capable of surpassing silicon and silica in a new generation of photonic devices. The requirement for a new platform stems from difficulties in translating silicon to the quantum regime where the properties of colour centres optically active defects in diamond are uniquely suited. Diamond in principle is a material par excellence . It has the largest optical bandgap of any material which provides it with many potential electronic optical and thermal applications 1. Furthermore diamond is biocompatible and chemically robust. Although recent advances in the perfection of diamonds have been dramatic arguably of more interest is the precise control and application of diamonds colour centres which can be harnessed for quantum sensing and labelling applications. Diamond has a unique combination of properties that is not found in any other material. New nanofabrication techniques and the availability of highquality synthetic diamonds have together led to an explosion of interest in the application of diamond to important twentyfirst century technological problems. This Review discusses some of the emerging photonic applica tions of diamond and the material properties that underpin them. Such applications include classical and quantum applications and particularly those enabled by optically active colour centres. Some of the most interesting properties of these colour centres derive from their spin properties  in particular those of negatively charged nitrogenvacancy NV colour centres  but for this we refer the reader to the review of Awschalom et al. 2Here we cover the lessreviewed areas of diamond in the fields of biomarking and nanoscopy methods for enhancing the emission of colour centres using external structures and the push towards the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics QED. The development of quantum information and communication technologies represents a grand scientific challenge. By designing informationprocessing platforms that exploit all the laws of physics  particularly quantum entanglement  it will be possible to efficiently solve ever more complex quantum mechanical problems such as those related to the chemistry of proteins and other biomolecules or the physics of quantum phase transitions. Furthermore quantum mechanics gives rise to effects that cannot be explained through classical treatments and this provides enhanced efficiency for certain techniques such as factoring or protocols that are not possible classically such as quantum key distribution. The intense race for a platform based on quantum informa tion and communication technologies has given rise to a plethora of candidate platforms and architectures. Among these diamond has emerged not only as a roomtemperature solidstate platform for applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum magnetometry but also as a promising lowtemperature platform for largescale quantum computing. This promise stems from dia monds range of bright highdipole moment colour centres that exhibit emission from the visible to the nearinfrared. One of these  the negatively charged NV centre  exhibits roomtem perature spin polarization and singlespin readout and can be used to cool nearby spins 34. The biocompatibility and colour centre photostability of diamond also make it an important platform for biological applications where it can be utilized in subdiffraction imaging techniques. Material developments including access to highquality lowbirefringence diamond has increased interest in diamond Raman lasers which have wide applications across an unprecedented spectral range. In this Review we will first discuss the optical properties of dia mond that enable many of its photonic applications. Then we will discuss techniques for fabricating both nanocrystal and large single crystal diamonds including postfabrication micro and nanosculpting. Finally we will cover classical applications such as biomarking and nanoscopy before discussing the coupling of colour centres to resonant structures such as waveguides and cavities. Optical properties of diamond Utilizing the quantum states of light is one of the fundamental goals of photonics but this imposes stringent requirements. In particu lar ultralowloss optical fibres and compact atomcavity systems are required together with fewquantumbit quantum processors for operations such as quantum repeating 5. Identifying appropriate platforms for such tasks is not a trivial matter. Diamond exhibits an enviable list of properties for quantum applications. It is a wideband semiconductor 5.5 eV at room tem perature with a moderate refractive index of 2.4 and is optically transparent from the deepultraviolet to the infrared. Moreover diamond is an excellent thermal conductor 2  103Wm1K1 that exhibits low thermal expansion high breakdown voltage and high carrier mobility. With proper engineering and optimization diamond will offer a promising platform for a new generation of technological devices. School of Physics University of Melbourne Parkville 3010 Australia.

Owing to the large bandgap of diamond emission from such colour centres can escape the crystal without absorption. Moreover as will be dis cussed below some of these centres function as bright singlephoton sources SPSs at room temperature thus providing atomlike systems in a solidstate matrix. The ability to exploit the properties of colour centres in a diamond photonic platform has caused an explosion of interest in what is now known as quantum diamond . So far only a few colour centres in diamond have been identi fied as bright SPSs. Following the first demonstration of single photon extraction from an NV centre 7 at least four new centres showing nonclassical emission have been identified. The NV complex is the most studied of all colour centres and it has already been exploited as a source of single photons in practical quantum key distribution systems 89. NV centres exist in one of two charge states NV and NV0 which have zerophonon lines of 637 nm and 575 nm respectively. Other diamondbased SPSs include the siliconvacancy SiV centre1011 738 nm a nickel nitrogen complex known as NE81214 793802 nm chromium related emitters1516 750770 nm and a carbonrelated TR12 centre17 470 nm among others1820. It seems highly unlikely that these five centres are the totality of bright SPSs in diamond. Most SPSs in diamond including the SiV  NE8 and NV centres mentioned above possess a threelevel emission scheme. Thus in addition to the desired optical transition these centres have a parallel decay channel that may be either radiative or nonradiative. Most diamond SPSs identified so far have a transition to a metastable state which is characterized by a long emission time thereby reducing singlephoton emission and altering the emission statistics.

This family of centres therefore achieves high emission rates which will be advantageous for future metrological applications. Diamond materials Diamond for photonic applications can be broadly categorized into three groups individual nano and microcrystalline diamond ultranano and polycrystalline diamond films and singlecrystal diamond plates. Each has its own advantages for photonic applications although the properties of the hosted colour centres differ between platforms particularly with the varying impurity concen trations within a given platform. In particular the role of the crystal surface seems to be critical in determining the properties of many of these colour centres. The choice for a specific type of diamond is often inherently determined by the application itself. For emerging applications such as biomarking diamond nanocrystals such as singledigit nanodia monds 2225 nanodiamonds with a crystal size below 10 nm are the leading candidates. On the other hand large single crystals of dia mond are preferred for applications that require purity and spectral stability. There has also been success in the development of hybrid systems which involve positioning precharacterized nanodia monds so as to interact with photonic structures formed in more conventional photonic media 2631. In this section we first discuss nano and microcrystalline diamond before covering large singlecrystal diamond wafers. Nano and microcrystalline diamond There are several existing methods for fabricating nanodiamonds and the most efficient among these is the detonation process. In this technique the explosive acts as the carbon source and the required high Figure 1  NV centres in nanodiamond and singlecrystal diamond. ab Scanning electron microscopy image  a and corresponding confocal map  b of deposited nanodiamonds.

Although a thorough purification process is required to clean the diamond par ticles from the soot this technique allows for the massproduction of sub10nm nanodiamonds. Particles of detonated diamond are commonly used as seeds for further nanodiamond growth through chemical vapour deposi tion CVD 3334. Figure 1a shows a scanning electron microscope of nanodiamonds grown using microwaveassisted CVD35 from 46 nm diamond seeds. Figure 1b shows a roomtemperature confocal map recorded from the same diamond nanocrystals. Bright spots show the emission from NV centres embedded in the nanocrystals. Some of the crystals host only a single NV centre as can be seen from photon correlation measurements Fig. 1c. Nanodiamonds can alternatively be produced through the crushing or milling of synt hetic or natural diamonds 36. However this method not only results in nonuniform crystal sizes and thus requires further steps to reach the nanoscale but also has a signifi cantly lower yield than that of the detonation process. Nevertheless working with synthetic crystals permits the controlled introduction of optically active impurities such as nitrogen which can then be incorporated into the nanodiamonds. Diamond wafers Monolithic singlecrystal diamonds typical size of 3 mm  3 mm 0.3 mm are now grown by a number of commercial companies. Bulk crystals can be grown either through the highpressure high temperature HPHT technique or by highplasmadensity CVD. The HPHT process is complicated requires highmaintenance equipment and provides minimal flexibility for controlling dopants thus making CVD the more common method for growing highpurity diamond crystals. CVD can also produce highquality single crystals through homoepitaxial growth 137. At the pressures used for the CVD growth technique graphite  not diamond  is the stable phase of carbon. Growth is therefore driven by kinetics not equilibrium thermody namics. The main advantages of the CVD process over the HPHT technique is its simplicity flexibility and control over the incorpora tion of impurities. The extreme control provided by CVD has also led to the pro duction of pure diamond with nitrogen and boron impurities at the partsperbillion level. It is also possible to produce isotopically pure diamond in which the 13C concentration is reduced from the native level of 1.2 to less than 0.3. Furthermore diamond plates have uniform and reproducible properties which have allowed diamond to be used as an engineering material for the first time. For quantum applications advances such as isotopic enrichment and low back ground impurity levels have led to reduced electron spin decoherence rates and narrower photoluminescence lines. The colour centre properties of singlecrystal diamond can therefore be superior to comparable emitters in other forms of diamond such as films or individual nanodiamonds. Figure 1d shows an optical image of typical high purity CVD plates. Figure 1e shows a 20 m 2 confocal map of such a plate with an isolated single NV centre and Fig. 1f shows the crystal lographic structure of the NV centre. Another important development is the ability to grow lowbirefringence diamonds which has led to renewed interest in diamond lasers discussed below. Birefringence arises because of dislocations and strain during the crystal growth process37. Typically HPHT treatment reduces the amount of dislocations and aids the production of lowbirefringence material37. Nanofabrication of singlecrystal diamond structures Readily available diamond wafers with reproducible properties open the possibility to fabricate practical monolithic diamond photonic structures. However diamond is chemically inert which makes accurate etching a significant challenge. Although a complete toolkit similar to that available for semiconductors such as silicon has not yet been developed significant progress in the nanomachining of dia mond has been demonstrated including as ringresonator structures Fig. 2a 41 waveguides Fig. 2b42 and nanopillars Fig. 2cd43. The principal step for many integrated optical or electronic cir cuits is to create a sacrificial layer. Although this is difficult to achieve in diamond there is one approach that seems to work quite well. Subsurface sacrificial layers can be made using a modification of the liftoff  technique 44 commonly employed in the formation of synthetic diamonds from seed crystals. Ion implantation is then used to create a buried damage layer or layers when annealed this layer changes into a graphitic material that is susceptible to chemical etching4145. This method can be used to make thin membranes of singlecrystal diamond which can be further processed to create structures46 and then removed from the substrate for subsequent device integration. Generating inplane structures requires different methodologies from the highenergy implantation technique discussed above. Laser ablation can be employed to cut large areas 47 but this is usually too coarse for most optical structures. A useful method for creating single devices is focused ionbeam milling41. The simultaneous fabrication of multiple devices can be achieved using electronbeambased pattern ing and reactive ion etching. Figure 2b shows a diamond waveguide etched from singlecrystal diamond. A more sophisticated example is an array of diamond nanowires43 etched from monolithic single crystal diamond Fig. 2c. The original diamond substrate shown here included nitrogen and thus single NV centres are natively present in the diamond nanowires. Researchers achieved an orderofmagnitude enhancement in the fluorescence from certain NVs embedded in the nanowires which clearly demonstrates the potential of nanostruc tured diamond devices. Furthermore the zerophonon line of such NV centres was recently coupled to modes of a diamond microring cavity etched directly from singlecrystal diamond 48. Quality factors of 4000 were measured from this device which marks a great mile stone towards integrated diamond photonics. Applications In this section we highlight several of diamonds applications. We also discuss the main advantages and challenges of each material as a diamond platform for classical and quantum applications. Classical applications. Diamond has a number of niche applications that employ its unique optical electrical and thermal properties. ab cd20m 1m 5m 1m Figure 2  Singlecrystal diamond photonic structures. a A diamond ring as a prototype for a whisperinggallery mode resonator. b Diamond waveguide guiding green laser light. c Diamond nanowires fabricated from singlecrystal diamond. d Highmagnication image of three nanowires.

All rights reserved.400 NATURE PHOTONICS  VOL 5  JULY 2011  www.nature.comnaturephotonicsFor example diamond windows were used on some of the Russian Venera probes to protect cameras from the corrosive highpressure environment on Venus and diamond windows are often used for applications in which chemical resistance robustness to large pressure gradients or low thermal expansion are required. A related development is the fabrication of diamond microlenses for opto electronic devices 4950. Diamond also shows promise for highenergy particle detection5152 heat spreaders for thermal managment53 pho todetectors54 ultraviolet LEDs55 and nearinfrared LEDs56. Diamond Raman lasers have emerged as an important platform for generating intense yellow light 573 nm5758. One of the main applications for such radiation is in the treatment of skin diseases as this wavelength corresponds to the peak absorption of oxyhae moglobin. Diamonds high thermal conductivity makes it ideal for highpower applications and its high Raman gain coefficient means that only small crystals are required. Although the principal target wavelength is yellow the wide optical transparency of diamond allows for tunable Raman sources across multiple spectral ranges 5961. In addition to their yellow laser the Macquarie group also recently demonstrated a deepultraviolet laser. Figure 3 shows photographs of their singlecrystal diamond Raman yellow laser and a schematic of the experimental setup. Most classical applications that employ single crystals of diamond do not require complex fabrication techniques and commercially available HPHT diamond plates are usually sufficient. However there is nonetheless a demand for the fabrication of largesize lowcost diamond wafers approaching the size of commercial silicon wafers. Meeting this demand would allow alldiamond devices such as radiation detectors and highpower lasers to make the transition from niche devices to mainstream products. It is not clear at present if this goal can be reached simply through a linear extrapolation of existing processes or whether new breakthroughs in diamond fabrication will be required. Biomarking. Fluorescent biomarkers have opened a new window into the study of cellular processes. Fluorescent diamond nanoc rystals offer new advantages over more conventional biomark ers such as green fluorescent protein owing to their brightness and photostability and compare favourably with quantum dots because of their biocompatibility 246267. Nanoparticles can be func tionalized with various biomolecules68 such as peptides proteins and DNA6971. So far the smallest nanodiamonds bright enough for biomarking applications are 19 nm in diameter72. These were massproduced by the ion irradiation of nonluminescent nano diamonds64. Figure 3c shows that the fluorescence from these nanodiamonds is an order of magnitude brighter than that of a traditional red chromophore. Figure 3de shows other examples of biomarking using nanodiamond crystals. However recent studies have involved smaller nanodiamonds because these are more likely to pass freely through membranes. In particular there is a push to develop stable bright singledigit nanodiamonds 253236. Recent studies have demonstrated the spin detection of a single NV embedded in a 7nmdiameter nanodiamond crystal 22. This is extremely significant for applications in bioimaging and nanosensing as will be discussed in the following sections. 20mDistal gonad Oocytes  02468 1 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0051015202530 DsRed FNDNumber of events Fluorescence intensity counts ms1NdYAG 22 W 1064 nm 78 MHzLBO M1M2 M3M4L19 W 532 nm 2.2 WxDiamond c d ea b 10m Figure 3  Classical applications of diamond. a Synchronously pumped diamond Raman laser operating at 573 nm its rst Stokes wavelength image courtesy of Eduardo Granados. b Schematic of the diamond Raman laser in ref. 61.

All rights reserved.NATURE PHOTONICS  VOL 5  JULY 2011  www.nature.comnaturephotonics 401One of the key breakthroughs in understanding cell processes has been the realtime imagin g of cell dynamics. Recent studies have involved the threedimensional tracking of single fluorescent nanodiamonds inside cells 64 as well as preliminary experiments of imaging living cells62 drug delivery and targeted bioimaging69. The recent discovery of new ultrabright colour centres with narrow emission in the nearinfrared is significant for such tracking techniques 15 as these wavelengths do not interfere with cell autofluores cence. However no massproduction technique yet exists that can incorporate such bright emitters into nanodiamonds. Improving the quality of nanodiamond colour centres towards those of emitters in bulk diamond requires a better understanding of the chemical and physical environments surrounding each colour centre. Fabricating subnanometre diamonds with stable luminescent defects remains a grand challenge in nanodiamond production. The ability to functionalize nanodiamonds 68 is a key element to continued progress in biomarking particularly for the use of nano diamonds in drug delivery and targeted bioimaging. Acid treat ment techniques can be used to prepare carboxylated surfaces for bioconjugation. Such nanodiamonds hosting optical defects can be used as delivery vehicles for transporting drugs genes and vaccines into cells 69. Functionalization with magneto markers71 will provide new bioimaging possibilities. The agglomeration of nanodiamonds is a serious issue for many diamondbased quantum and biological applications. One of the main solutions at present is to use isolated nanodiamonds although this is clearly not a satisfactory approach for scalable production processes. The deagglomeration of nanodiamonds into their primary size is an important but complex alternative 32. Researchers have so far investigated the mechanical deagglomeration of nano diamond suspensions using stirre d media milling beadassisted sonic disintegration and the use of chemical modification and detergents 24327374 although the optimal technique is not yet known. Nanoscopy. Nanoscopy is the emerging field of optical microscopy at the nanoscale in particular using visiblewavelength photons and techniques to improve resolution far beyond the diffraction limit. All optical nanoscopic techniques employ some form of optical nonlin earity or spatially nonuniform field as in the case of MRI scanning to beat conventional imaging limitations. Diamond colour centres therefore have considerable potential in the field of nanoscopy. The photostability of NVs enables them to be imaged using stim ulated emission depletion STED microscopy 7576. This technique uses two beams a Gaussian mode to excite the emitter and an STED beam to deplete the excited state through stimulated emission eve rywhere that the field is nonzero. The technique provides high spatial resolution because the only region that is undepleted  and hence fluoresces  is the central dot of the STED beam. The resolu tion is set by the intensity of the STED beam the more intense the beam the smaller the radius of the central undepleted region and hence the more welldefined the location of the emitter. The source under investigation must be photostable because the STED beam is extremely intense thus making diamondbased SPSs the ultimate choice for this technique. Figure 4a shows a confocal map recorded from an ensemble of conventionally unresolvable NVs. However once the STED beam is applied the emitters can be optically resolved and with the assist ance of fitting parameters their location can be determined with subnanometre resolution 75. Using STED threedimensional imaging from densely packed single emitters with extreme subdiffraction resolution is feasible. Applying an axial beam pattern allows the superresolution imaging of NV centres 6 m deep inside the diamond crystal Fig. 4b. Magnetometry is another fascinating application for which dia mond centres are considered to be prime candidates. Employing NV centres revolutionary demonstrations of sensing magnetic fields at the nanoscale at room temperature and under ambient conditions have been performed 7779. Such groundbreaking results may eventu ally allow single spins in biological molecules to be measured which cannot be achieved through traditional electron spin resonance tech niques. The use of diamond centres in magnetometry is based on the ability to measure the electron spin of an NV centre by exciting it with a green laser and switching the microwave frequency in close prox imity to the centre. A simple NV magnetometer can be constructed by attaching an NV nanodiamond to a magnetic tip and scanning it over a specific substrate 78. The NV centre can alternatively be embed ded in ultrapure singlecrystal diamond where it is used to sense externally applie d magnetic fields77. Researchers have proposed the sensing of fluctuating magnetic fields by probing the dephasing rate of the NV spin quantum bit placed in such an environment which should ultimately allow the detection of ion channels80. Quantum applications. Quantum optical applications are the core of diamond photonics. Although remarkable progress has been achieved there are still significant hurdles to overcome before dia mond photonic devices can begin to constitute a practical quantum technology. The main issue is to optimize the emission from highquality centres into defined radiative modes. This inexorably leads to the requirement that diamond emitters are coupled to optical structures especially cavities 8182 and waveguides in a fashion that either preserves or improves their optical properties83.

The expression QV is an impor tant figure of merit for cavity design that clearly emphasizes the need for high Q and low V. Enhancing the spontaneous emission through the Purcell effect is the first step towards the realization of quantum systems because it can assi st with directional emission and the generation of indistinguishable photons. Many of the most powerful protocols for quantum informa tion and communication technologies with diamond employ the strong coupling limit of cavity QED which achieve a reversible interaction between the emitter and the cavity 8182. Such coherent control allows energy to be transferred between the cavity and the emitter for a finite period of time through optical Rabi oscil lations. The Rabi frequency must be fast compared with the cavity loss rate and decoherence processes including absorption. High Q can be understood as the minimization of decoherence whereas decreased mode volume results in increased Rabi frequency. High Q and low V are therefore essential for the strong coupling regime and researchers have already designed alldiamond cavities that operate in this regime 84. Cavity QED has been demonstrated with atoms single molecules and quantum dots8182 but not yet with col our centres in diamond. Developing scalable technology to sculpt diamond waveguides cavities and integrate them with current SPSs is a longterm goal in the field of diamond photonics. Early studies explored the fabrica tion of photonic crystal cavities in diamond films 8586. However in these cases scattering losses surface roughness and high impurity concentration in the films limited Q values to around a few hun dred 85. Furthermore optical properties such as the linewidth and spectral stability of active emitters in CVD films or nanodiamonds are poor compared with the same emitters in bulk diamond. Quantum computation and communication applications therefore have a strong incentive to exploit colour centres in monolithic singlecrystal diamonds 16404387. There has also been significant focus on hybrid systems in addi tion to monolithic diamond approaches. Such hybrids combine mature photonic platforms with bright emitters in either nanodiamond or singlecrystal diamond. GaP is a useful platform for such systems because of its transparency in the visible the range of machining techniques available and its high refractive index 3.25 which allows for the efficient coupling of light and the use of advanced high Q smallvolume photonic crystal cavity designs. This approach has been used to deposit GaP waveguides 8889 and microdisks90 directly onto singlecrystal diamond. In such cases emission from NV centres close to the diamond interface is coupled to the waveguide or the cavity modes. This design is a prototype of a possible onchip nanophotonic device that employs diamond single emitters as its fundamental constituents. Although emitters in singlecrystal diamond possess narrower and more stable spectral lines nanodiamonds are very convenient for hybrid applications. Researchers have placed individual nanocrystals 3891 on top of photonic crystal cavities29 and coupled the resulting emission to optical fibres92 waveguides8889 microspheres93 microdisks2831 and toroidal resonators27. The deterministic place ment of a GaP cavity slab onto a diamond nanocrystal has also been experimentally demonstrated30. Figure 5 shows examples of various diamond nanophotonic components including photonic crystal cavities microdisks and toroidal microresonators. A GaP microdisk placed on top of singlecrystal diamond can achieve Q values of around 25000 ref. 90 whereas other systems exhibit lower values of around 1000. The superiority of the GaP microdisk highlights the importance of material quality when designing an appropriate cavity QED system. Diamond nanoparticles scatter from both surface and bulk defects which reduces Q despite highquality cavity fabrication. It is there fore clear that cavities of singlecrystal diamond must be developed GaP 1m 1m 10m Diamond 500 nmMicrodiskDiamond nanocrystal 1 0 30 15 0 15 E2Height nm a de fc b 1m 10m400 nm Figure 5  Diamond nanophotonic components. a 2D photonic crystal cavity made from a nanodiamond lm. bc GaP microdisk  b and GaP waveguide c deposited on singlecrystal diamond. d Manipulating nanodiamond hosting a single emitter onto a toroidal microresonator using a bre taper. e Nanodiamond hosting a single emitter on a silica microdisk. f Atomic force microscopy image of a diamond nanocrystal placed in a GaP photonic crystal cavity top and the simulated electric eld prole of the cavitys fundamental mode bottom.

Researchers have also explored the resonant coupling of dia mond SPSs to plasmonic waveguides. The understanding of a single emitting dipole in the proximity of a metal is important because such coupling modifies the dipoles emission lifetime and spectral distribution. For single emitters this coupling is analogous to a cav ity Purcell enhancement and can therefore not only significantly enhance the emitted count rate but also improve directionality thus providing an enhanced SPS. Figure 6 shows two examples of how single NV centres can be coupled to plasmonic structures. In Fig. 6ab a single diamond nanocrystal is coupled to one or two gold nanoparticles 94. Timeresolved measurements show a decrease in the excited state lifetime by factors of 7.5 and 9.5 for configurations i and ii respectively94. The emission rate of the coupled nanodia mond was also enhanced. Figure 6cd shows a diamond nanocrystal coupled to a silver nanowire95 in which researchers demonstrated the waveparticle duality of surface plasmon polaritons. The main challenge in plasmonic coupling is aligning the emit ting dipole of the nanocrystal with the propagation mode of the plasmon. In the case of an NV centre in which the emitting dipoles are perpendicular and the roomtemperature emission is not polar ized this coupling results in high losses. Novel diamond emitters that exhibit linear dipole behaviour 15 are therefore more promising than NV centres for plasmonic coupling. A key application of single photons is for quantum key distri bution96 particularly because long photon coherence and indistin guishability are not required. Quantum key distribution has been demonstrated using an NV centre as the SPS9 but this situation is far from ideal. In freespace tr ansmission emission at 637 nm is highly absorbed by the atmosphere and the large emission width 100 nm causes significant dispersion in fibreoptic systems. Furthermore the emission from an NV centre is not fully polar ized which further reduces efficiency. Narrowband polarized SPSs are therefore used to improve efficiency. Challenges One aspect of diamond fabrication that has not yet been satisfactorily addressed is the creation of an ensemble of highspectralquality single emitters in close proximity to the crystal surface. Such a system has its origins in the hybrid approach in which SPS emis sion is coupled and transmitted through a conventional photonic medium 8990. Achieving this is a new optimization challenge that is different from the more conventional task of optimizing the yield in bulk diamond or nanodiamond. Additionally the influence of the lattice environment on the optical properties of the centre and methods to controllably fabricate ensembles of centres with similar physical and optical properties are still not understood. Methods of controlling a centres charge state are also unclear but research in this direction is progressing 97. Diamond machining is currently a major limitation in the devel opment of alldiamond photonic platforms. Singlecrystal diamond cannot be grown heteroepitaxially and therefore conventional sacrificial layer and etching techniques such as those used to fabricate GaAs or Si are not applicable. The chemical inertness of diamond is a significant hurdle for diamond nanofabrication and further research is necessary before alldiamond platforms can become viable alternatives to hybrid designs. Fabrication yield  the number of optically active defects created for each implanted ion  is also an important figure of merit 9899. In the case of NV centres excess nitrogen leads to increased decoher ence through the presence of fluctuating charges as well as excess elec tronic and nuclear spins so an accurate estimation of the conversion efficiency between residualimplanted nitrogen and optically active centres is required. Recent results seem to indicate that an increase in yield can be achieved by implanting nitrogen ions deep in a crystal using megaelectronvolt implantation energies 100 although the mechanisms for the increase are unclear and open to interpretation. For hybrid schemes employing nanocrystals the optical prop erties of the NV centre degrade as the crystal size is reduced. Proximity to the surface induces charge fluctuations and instabilities in the spectrum which often causes severe blinking. The coherence time is also reduced and consequently Fouriertransformlimited emission has not yet been observed from a diamond nanocrystal. Surface chemistry seems to be a chief parameter for resolving this problem. Coreshell methods were developed to stop the blinking in quantum dots 101. Inspired by this method Bradac and coworkers demonstrated that the emission from NV centres is stable with no blinking when 5 nm nanodiamonds are embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol film 97. Such approaches suggest new directions that may Figure 6  Plasmonics with NV centres in diamond. ab Atomic force microscopy images  a and simulated emission enhancement  b of diamond nanocrystals left to which one middle or two right gold nanoparticles are coupled. c Atomic force microscopy image of diamond nanocrystal hosting a single NV centre attached to a silver nanowire. d Wideeld image of a single quantum emitter NV centre coupled to a silver nanowire.

Summary and outlook Research into diamond photonics is gaining momentum around the world. However there are several key impediments to the techno logical applications of diamond colour centres including improvements to the spectral properties of the available colour centres. In some cases these improvements will be made by identifying and optimizing new and existing centres and in other cases through the improved integration of colour centres with enhanced collection optics such as solid immersion lenses 102103 and cavities. This will open up applications for diamond in quantum information science and quantum metrology. Control of the base material and surface effects are crucial for achieving viable technological advances. The nanomachining of diamond is in its infancy and although we have seen some dramatic demonstrations a mature fabrication toolkit has yet to be developed. Nevertheless the outlook is exciting. Diamond photonics is a thriving field particularly given the recent demonstra tions of ultrahighpurity synthetic diamonds new colour centres new photonic designs and new applications. The advent of robust roomtemperature quantum platforms are sure to make diamond a breakthrough technology of the twentyfirst century. References 1. Balmer R. S. et al.

It is known for its ability to maximize a diamonds sparkle and brilliance due to its precise faceting. Diamond certification is a process in which a diamond is evaluated and graded based on its characteristics such as carat weight cut color and clarity known as the 4Cs. This evaluation is conducted by a reputable gemological laboratory such as the Gemological Institute of America GIA or the International Gemological Institute IGI. A certificate detailing these characteristics is provided to verify the diamonds quality and authenticity. The diamond industry is vast and there isnt one definitive top diamond dealer globally. However some of the largest and most wellknown diamond companies include De Beers Alrosa and Rio Tinto. These companies are known for their extensive involvement in diamond mining and trade. Diamond impurities or inclusions are natural features within a diamond that can affect its clarity. Signs of diamond impurities include internal flaws such as feathers crystals or needles. Surface blemishes may include pits or scratches. These imperfections are often evaluated and rated on a clarity scale ranging from Flawless to Included. Blood diamonds also known as conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance armed conflict against governments. The term gained widespread awareness due to humanitarian concerns related to unethical mining practices and exploitation. Efforts such as the Kimberley Process have been established to prevent the trade of conflict diamonds. The diamond industry has a long and storied history. Diamonds were first discovered and mined in India around the 4th century BCE. The industry expanded with the discovery of diamond deposits in South Africa in the late 1800s which led to the establishment of large diamond mining companies like De Beers. Today diamonds are sourced from various regions worldwide including Russia Australia and Canada. Major players in the diamond market include companies involved in diamond mining trading and retailing. De Beers Alrosa and Rio Tinto are some of the leading diamond mining companies. In terms of retail companies like Tiffany  Co. Cartier and Graff Diamonds are wellknown luxury brands in the diamond jewelry market. The number of diamonds used in highend jewelry can vary depending on the design and size of the piece. For example a solitaire engagement ring may feature a single prominent diamond while a necklace or bracelet might include multiple smaller diamonds set in intricate patterns. Highend jewelry pieces often focus on quality and artistry with diamonds chosen for their exceptional cut clarity color and carat weight. Langsmith is likely a reference to an expert or resource specializing in diamond appraisals. An expert like Langsmith can teach us how to evaluate diamonds based on the 4Cs carat cut color and clarity how to identify diamond treatments or enhancements and how to properly assess the value of a diamond. They may also provide guidance on recognizing reputable grading certificates and authenticating diamonds. To say that diamond is the king or queen of gems is not modern hyperbole. Two thousand years ago the Roman writer Pliny the Elder told his readers that diamond was so rare it was the preserve of kings a millennium later the medieval Persian writer al Br n said that diamonds position among gems was like that of a king among his subjects. Pliny and al Brn are just tw o of many writers who have discussed the properties of diamonds at length. Some of what they have said is remarkably scientic some fanciful. For the modern gemologist the properties that dene a gem are rarity durability and beauty. Ideas of beauty may have changed since the days of Pliny or al Brn but they would recog nize 1 T he Diamond the importance of rarity and durability. Rarity and hardness have made diamond a symbol of power invulnerability and ultimately love. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance and its name reects this. Diamond and its European variants such as diamant and diamante derive via Latin from the ancient Greek adamas. In Greek dama had the sense of conquer or tame. The addition of the Greek negative prex a made it adamas unconquerable or invincible a suitable name for this exceptionally hard material. In medieval Europe this prex disappeared and we begin to nd references to dyamon diamans and other variant spellings eventually standardized in English as diamond. T his chapter will explain something of diamonds unique nature and how it occurs and then look at some of the myth and symbolism that has been attached to it and why. T he Occurrence Form and Properties of Diamond Diamond is formed deep within the earth and is unique among gems in being composed of a single chemical element carbon in a compact crystalline form. This simple composition and Figure 1.1. Diagram of an octahedral diamond crystal showing how it can split cleave in directions parallel to a crystal face. Drawing Jack Ogden. Figure 1.2.

Some diamonds thus survive the extreme conditions of the volcanic activity that transports them to the surface of the earth where millions of years of erosion can leave them in the sands and gravels of past or present river valleys. These riverbed or alluvial diamonds are found in various parts of the world but until the 1600s India was by far the most important if not the only source of diamonds for the Mediterranean and European worlds. T he textbook shape of a diamond crystal is an octahedron like two square based pyramids base to base gur e 1.1. Indeed several Renaissance travelers described the shape of the pyramids of Egypt as being lik e pointed diamonds Hakluyt 1599 417 Lithgow 1614 n.p.. Early Indian texts and the Roman writer Pliny described this octahedral form and we can see natural octahedral diamond crystals set in ancient and medieval rings such as the Roman ring in gure 1.2 which dates from the third century AD. One of the earliest illustrations of octahedral diamonds is in a Franco Flemish manuscript of about 1270 where four diamonds can be seen in a rocky outcrop gure 1.3. 1 A century later an early travelogue written by Sir John Mandeville probably a ctitious name gives a charming description of a natural octahedral diamond crystal as square and poynted of here owne kynde bothe aboven and benethen with outen worchinge of mannes handethat is square and pointed of her own kind both above and beneath without working of mans hand Halliwell Phillipps 1839 158. Although the octahedral form is the most iconic shape of diamond crystal other crystal forms occur and few are perfect octahedra. A group of diamond crystals is shown in gure 1.4. An old example of a particularly irregular form is the large brown diamond in the Late Roman ring in gure 1.5 which is an intergrowth of two diamond crystals. At about seven carats 1.4 grams this is by far the largest diamond I know from the ancient world Ogden 1973b. The brown color lacks the attraction of modern fancy colored diamonds but it is also a reminder that diamonds do occur in various colors with the more attractive ones now demanding very high prices. In the past color was often referred to as water with a perfectly colorless gem described as of the best water while one with a slight yellow cast might be described as having a yellowish water. Some diamonds were broken during their long geological history. Although highly resistant to scratching diamonds can break under impact or pressure splitting along specic directions relative to their crystal structure see gure 1.1. This susceptibility to splitting is taken advantage of in the process called cleaving which can be used as a preliminary to cutting in order to remove a badly awed area of a diamond crystal trim one to a more suitable shape for cutting or allow the production of two or more cut stones from a single crystal. All diamonds as found in nature regardless of the completeness or perfection of their crystal form are referred to as rough diamonds. Ancient observers were intrigued by crystals in general and speculated on how they formed. Renaissance philosophers believed gems were some sort of congealed liquid or juice. Thus the seventeenth century Fr ench philosopher and Catholic theologian Antoine le Grand explained A Diamond sparkles the brightest of all other Precious Stones and strikes the Eye with the most brisk and dazling splendor. The Reason is because it consists of a most pure Juice whose parts are so divided by straining that they Reect and Refract the Rays they have received from all sides of them le Grand 1694 130. This latter comment is probably a reference to the remarkable re in a diamond the rainbow hues caused by the way in which light passing through a diamond is broken up much as light passing through a prism is separated into the colors of the rainbow. This e ect is referred to technically as the dispersion of a diamond a nd modern faceting is designed to best show it o . The eect is seen with a well  shaped clea r diamond crystal and was noted from an early period. The Garuda Puranam a Sanskrit book that probably dates to the fourth or fth century AD and was certainly in existence by the tenth explained dispersion with a mystical avor. A diamond scintillating with ashes of rainbow colored hue at the center . . . blesses its wearer with a prosperous family and well lled granaries . A king wearing a diamond dazzling with lightning ashes is sure to subdue the prowess of his neighboring monarchs and to exercise an unbounded control upon his vassals and liege subjects Dutt 1908 186. The medieval Persian sages al Brn and Nishbr the latte r better known in the west as the poet Omar Khayyam were among those who explained how the e ect could be seen if a diamond crystal was stood upright in the sunlight using a bit of wax to support it Said 1989 76 Nshbr 2004. The presence of a clear rainbow eect proved the stone was a good one. A few centuries later in England Thomas Nicols seems to be describing dispersion in a diamond when he says It will snatch color and apply it and unite it to itself and thus will it cast forth at a great distance its lively shining rayes so that no other jewell can sparkle as it will. By this excellent emission of its rayes or beams or by this generous sparkling forth of its glory do the most judicious Jewellers distinguish the true Diamond from those of bastard kinds Nicols 1652 46. Clarity T he quality of a diamond has also been long dened by its clarity that is the absence or presence of internal features such as small ssures or inclusions. The most widespread approach to diamond grading today that developed by the Gemological Institute of America GIA in part quanties clarity on the basis of what is visible using a magnifying glass with ten times magnication. Awareness of these internal features and their categorization as defects is not new. Early Indian texts explain how crows feet and other marks render diamonds less eicacious while seventeenth  century Europe an documents use picturesque terms such as icicles and clouds to describe the interior features that can lower a diamonds value. In the seventeenth century Sir William Petty recommended that those with less than perfect eyesight use a microscope when assessing the value of a diamond Ogden 2012. Arguments for a practical use of magnication in the ancient world include the various transparent objects that have survived from antiquity that could in theory have acted as lenses. Lenses cut from crystal used to light res or cauterize wounds were certainly known in the ancient Greek world. The dialogue in Aristophaness The Clouds written in 419 BC includes Strepsiades asking Socrates Have you ever seen a beautiful transparent stone at the druggists with which you may kindle re and Socrates replying You mean a crystal lens. Three centuries later the Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca ca. 4 BCAD 65 commented in his Natural Questions 1.6 Letters however small and dim are comparatively large and distinct when seen through a glass globe lled with water Clark 1910 2930. On the other hand not a single classical writer mentions magnication as a practical tool for any craftsmen let alone lapidaries or jewelers. However there is a tantalizing statement from further east. The Garuda Puranam says A diamond found to be a ected with small defects whether visible or invisible to the naked eyes should be appraised at a price equal to a tenth part of that of a diamond of similar water and weight but devoid of all such blemishes. How might a defect invisible to the naked eye be taken into consideration unless magnication was available A mid fourteenth century fresco in the Basilica of San Nicol in Treviso northeast Italy shows a magnifying glass used to read a book but there is no evidence that magnication played any part in the day to day trade in diamo nds prior to the seventeenth century and even then it was probably uncommon. We begin to see people including jewelers wearing glasses in Renaissance paintings and in 1620 an Englishman Francis Bacon mentioned the possibility that a microscope might be useful for examining the latent minutiae and irregularities of gems Bacon and Montagu 1831 14 160. From about this same period we have the earliest representation of a magnifying glass for looking at jewelry gure 1.6. This is a drawing by Franois Pelgrim of Antwerp sent to the Dutch jeweler Arnold Lulls who relocated to London in 1585. This equipment consisted of a large circular lens suspended from cords that could be raised or lowered by means of a pulley system. Diamond Symbolism It is not surprising that rare transparent shiny and often attractively shaped diamond crystals became coveted by the rich and powerful. The hardness of diamond made it a symbol for steadfastness and invincibility whether this represented royal power the walls of Jerusalem or true love. Early Indian texts are the most e usive about the powers of a diamond and make it clear that the better the quality of the stone the more power ful it was. For example the Garuda Puranam says Serpents tigers and thieves y from the presence of a person wearing such a diamond Dutt 1908 104. The text goes on to assure us that a wearer was protected from res and oods would have a healthy complexion and all his undertakings would thrive. T he masculine pronoun is noteworthy some Indians may have scorned the modern idea of a diamond as a girls best friend. As the Garuda Puranam also says Diamonds are prohibited as articles of female wear as they are possessed of the mystic virtues of making them sterile and unhappy Dutt 1908 185. Diamonds as a Symbol of Love Despite some early Indian views on diamonds and women the extreme hardness of diamond that had linked it with unconquerable kings also eventually made it the symbol of unwavering love. Today from San Francisco to Shanghai diamond is the predominate gem of choice in engagement and wedding rings. Cynics may complain that this tradition is an invention of modern marketing but they are wrong. In the West diamond rings ha ve been a part of some betrothals for many centuries indeed in the mid 1600s Thomas Nicols said that th e hardness of diamond meant that it could be used symbolically as a signication of constancy Nicols 1652 17. The diamond set r ing of Mary of Burgundy in gure 1.7 with her initial M delineated in what are now called hog back diamonds as discussed in Chapter 5 is often said to have been her betrothal ring when she married Maximilian I of Austria in 1477. There is no actual evidence for this but a diamond ring certainly played a part in her preparations for betrothal. On her fathers instructions she wrote a letter to Maximilians father promising that she would marry his son and her father enclosed a diamond ring of considerable value as a sign of sincerity. In 1475 just two years before Maximilian and Mary were married the wedding took place of Constanzo Sforza and Camilla DAragona from two of the most inuential families in Italy. A poem celebrating this union includes the words Two wills two hearts two passions are bonded in marriage by a diamond. An accompanying drawing shows a diamond ring encircling two burning torches and an attendant gure identied as Hymenaeus the old Greek god of wedding ceremonies wearing a robe embroidered with diamond rings and ames. We can nd an earlier mention of a diamond ring with love connections in England. The will of a wealthy widow Johanna Fastolf who died in 1417 includes a diamond ring inscribed Je Vous aime de tout moun coer I love you with all my heart Sharpe 1890 419. It is just possible that this referred to her devotion to God but it seems far more likely tha t it reected the a ection of her former husband and was her betrothal or marriage ring. Other fteenth century diamond rings that may have been betrothal rings include an Italian gold ring now in the British Museum shown in gure 1.8. The inscription here says Lorenzo a Lena Lena from Lawrence to Lena Lena Ward et al. 1981 197. A diamond ring of the previous century if not slightly earlier also in the British Museum might have been a love gift since it is inscribed here in place of a friend O. M. Dalton 1912 no. 1006. A ring set with a dyamond and a rubie is noted in the 1505 will of Marion Chamber of Bury in England where it is specically described as a maryeng ryng Tymms 1850 25. This suggests that the various surviving medieval rings with paired diamonds and rubies such as the ring in gure 1.9 were also wedding rings. This ring was found by a metal detectorist near Launde Abbey Leicestershire England.2 It may be thought sexist today but half a millennium ago it would have been perfectly reasonable to identify an in vincible diamond with the man and a red gem the color long associated with fertility with the woman. Once into the 1600s we begin to see more evidence of diamond rings associated with marriage both with surviving examples and with mentions in literature. The latter include a romantic short story The Two Damsels written in 1613 by Miguel de Cervantes of Don Quixote fame. Here a diamond ring is described as being engraved with the words Marco Antonio is the husband of Theodosia. A half century later in 1664 Jean Baptiste Po quelin better known as Molire wrote the play The Forced Marriage in which a man seeks to buy a diamond ring for his intended spouse. T he Goats Blood Myth One of the most ancient and rmly embedded of myths about diamond is that it could only be broken after steeping in goats blood. We rst nd this mentioned in Roman times when recounted by Pliny around AD 70 and then a century later by the Greek traveler and geographer Pausanius in his Description of Greece 8.18.6. The latter tells us that diamonds the hardest of stones are melted by the blood of the he goat. It is unc lear where Pliny might have heard the story since as the anthropologist and historian Berthold Laufer pointed out it is seemingly not encountered in Indian tradition Laufer 1915 6. In 1491 the rst edition of an early printed medicinal handbook the Hortus Sanitatis Garden of health was published in Mainz. The compiler is uncertain but the work is generally attributed to Johann Cuba and includes a section on minerals. An illustration that accompanies the description of diamond based on Plinys comments shows a man seated at a table on which is what appears to be a dish of diamonds soaking in goats blood gure 1.10. It also shows diamonds resisting re and a diamond tipped lapida ry tool. Proceeding through the centuries we nd Pope later Saint Gregory the Great 540604 saying that hard diamond admits not at all of incision by steel but is softened by the mild blood of goats and so on into the Middle Ages The Book of Pastoral Rule 313. Over the years the story became more involved eventually dening even the best diet for the goat. This supposed susceptibility to goats blood has been discussed by numerous writers since and once science dethroned superstition the story has usually been dismissed as nonsense. The rst to refute it was the thirteenth century Franciscan friar Roger Bacon but it was still several centuries before skepticism became the norm. In his 1606 text Gouldesmytthes Storehouse the London jeweler Hannibal Gammon repeats the story that diamonds can only be broken with use of goats blood but says but it is not soe Gammon 1606 66r. In 1658 Thomas Browne included the supposed use of goats blood to break a diamond among his common Tenents concerning minerall and Terreous bodies which examined prove either false or dubious T. Browne 1658 91 92. More recently an anonymous mid nineteenth century cor respondent to Notes and Queries magazine suggested Its origin would seem to be simply that necessity for lying which is inherent in Asiatics. 3 However a myth must start somewhere and perhaps here the most obvious origin would lie in some rite or sacrice. To break the unbreakable diamond was surely an inauspicious act in ancient India and the sacrice of a goat could well have been a way to propitiate the gods or spirits. We have no evidence for this but Robert Forbes a specialist in the history of technology discussed at length the rites superstitions and even sacrices that accompanied metalworking in antiquity and in some recent primitive societies and one might expect no less with breaking diamonds Forbes 1971 7180. More prosaically crushing diamonds to produce chips for lapidary work required some way to stop the minute chips ying o  and being lost. Some type of enclosing paste could serve. Might blood act like a paste in keeping the diamond fragments together Another possibility is that something that looked like blood was used. There is a Sanskrit recipe for diamond dust for use in medicine that describes mixing beaten cotton plant with the juice of the betel nut. The diamond is enclosed within this paste and roasted in a pit of re. The process is repeated seven times when the stone is easily reduced to a ne powder Dutt and King 1877 92. Betel juice has a blood like appea rance. Consider this 1967 advice from the United States Marine Corps Unit Leaders Personal Response Handbook written for U.S. military personnel serving in Vietnam and likely to encounter betel nut chewing U nless forewarned of this colorful habit when you rst see it you may think the chewer has a serious chest wound or at the very least is spitting up excessive blood. Perhaps inevitably with the early Christian writers the blood of a goat that could subdue the unconquerable diamond became the blood of the Lamb of God. Indeed early Christian writers repeat or seek to outdo Old Testament allegory when they compare the hardness of diamonds with the invincibility of the soul true faith and the like. St. John Chrysostom AD 347407 for example was particularly prone to using diamond in an allegorical sense in his copious writings. St. Paul was bold in the face of re hard as diamond rm and unshaken he who strikes a blow upon the diamond gets the shock of the blow himself and the rm soul is stronger even than a rock and harder than diamond to quote but a few. 4 When diamond was rst cut in later medieval Europe it had been considered invincible for some two millennia. It seems strange this didnt attract a church backlash. To nally bend diamond to the will of man surely overthrew Gods order it was impudence at best blasphemy at worst. Lead and Diamonds Blood was not the only substance that was supposed to facilitate the breaking of diamonds. Medieval writers repeatedly noted that diamond could only be cut by means of lead. Since lead is very soft and diamond very hard this phenomenon was regarded as magic by medieval European minds as a silly myth by later ones. This was neither magic nor myth it was a misunderstanding. The ancient use of diamond chips to drill and engrave other gems is well established see the next chapter and their manufacture was not complicated. Diamonds are relatively brittle despite being extremely hard and could be broken with a hammer. T he problem was that as Pliny warned these splinters could be so small as to be almost invisible  Natural History 37.15. One way to avoid loss was to wrap the diamond in a piece of lead prior to hitting it with a hammer. Al Brn explained that this pr evented the little splinters from falling and dispersing Said 1989 79. Later Muslim writersand otherssaid much the same. For example the thirteenth century Pe rsian writer Mohammed ben Mansur explained how diamonds could be broken by wrapping them in lead and then hitting this with a hammer Hammer 1818 346. The Armenian historian Arakel of Tabriz similarly explained to his readers The diamonds are crushed remain embedded in the lead and do not scatter Bournoutian 2006 447. Both he and Mansur added that wax or resin could be used in a similar waythe wax with trapped diamond particles would be put in boiling water where the wax melted and f loated and the diamond particles sank. A paste made from horn shavings could also be used it was said and possibly therein lies the origin of another ancient myth that diamond could be broken with a rams horn Dutt and King 1877 92. Diamond as Poison Another property commonly attributed to diamo nd in the past was its e ectiveness as a poison. Even the Renaissance goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini was fearful that he might be poisoned this way. However there seems to be no toxicological basis to this anxiety. In the eleventh century al Brn cast scorn on it. First h e noted an obvious practicality If it has not been ground well it will be betrayed by the teeth of the eater. This is perhaps the earliest reference to the grinding of diamond to a ne powder. Al Brn then cites a sc ientic experiment A dog was administered the diamond. It was a ected neither at the time nor was any e ect noted later. It is all idle talk without any substance. Even so according to Sir Jerome Horsey a sixteenth century English p olitician who traveled to Moscow as an agent for the Russia Company Ivan the Terrible had commented The least parcel of it diamond in powder will poysen a horse. 5 The sixteenth century Portug uese doctor Garcia de Orta would not have agreed. He quotes the case of a woman who fed up with caring for her sick husband tried to poison him with ground up di amonds but without success Markham 1913 344. De Ortas contemporary the sixteenth century Italian mathematician physician astrologer and philosopher Girolamo Cardano pointed out that people had swallowed diamonds in order to steal them without the least impairing of their Healths and that even a quantity of diamond powder had been swallowed without prejudicing the Health of the Taker any more than if he had eaten so much Bread quoted in le Grand 1694 130. One of the last recorded attempts at poisoning by diamond powder in Europe occurs in a complex scandal involving indelity and murder among the English aristocracy in the early seventeenth century. Anne Turner was a businesswoman with court connections who both ran a house of ill repute and was waiting woman to Frances Howard. Frances although the wife of the Earl of Essex was in love with King Jamess favorite Robert Carr rst Earl of Somerset and she wished her marriage annulled so she could marry him. Carrs secretary and adviser Sir Thomas Overbury disapproved of the match so Frances plotted to kill him. Anne Turner put Frances in touch with an apothecary named James Franklin to obtain poisons and she asked him whether he knewe the powder of Diamonds. He said noe and she said he was a foole and bad him git some of it from the cutters of Diamonds and al he could whatsoever it cost. Various poisons were tried at least one worked and Sir T homas Overbury died in September 1613. In what might be evidence of di erent justice for the rich than for the poor Anne Turner was hanged on 15 November 1615 and Frances Howard by then Lady Somerset was pardoned Owen 1971 23. T he best short refutation to the toxicity of diamond of more recent date is that by an anonymous correspondent to Notes and Queries in 1875 who said The only possible way in which it diamond powder could be injurious would be as a mechanical irritant to the mucous membrane of the stomach. 6 Even so the diamond dust as poison myth had to start somewhere presumably in the East and we might suspect that as diamond powder was a valuable commodity and easy to steal fear of poisoning would be an e ective security measure against concealing a small amount in the mouth. Diamonds have been recognized by man for perhaps two and a half millenniaa mere blink of an eye compared with the billions of years since they were formed. The nature of their composition and creation explain their exceptional properties particularly their hardness and optical qualities. This unparalleled hardness prompted their original use as a lapidary abrasive spawned many long lived myths and establish ed them as an emblem of power and constancy. The most perfect crystals would have had something of the shine and rainbow re that we associate with diamonds today but their true sparkle was revealed only after cutting and polishing developed. The following chapters will chart the history of the mining trade and use of diamonds and attempt to untangle the development of their cutting. Today diamonds are far commoner than the jewelry industry might be prepared to admit but for the period covered by this book they were rare and coveted truly the king of gems. T he earliest published diamond set piece of jewelry of which I am aware is a ring found in 1999 at A Khanoum ancient Eucratidea in the northeast of what is now Afghanistan gure 2.1 Bopearachchi and Flandrin 2005 11112. A Khanoum was probably founded in about 280 BC after Alexander the Great partitioned his empire. It was one of the most important cities in Greco Bactria and the magnicent nds excavated there are evidence for extensive trade with both the Greek world and India. The center stone in the ring is a pink sapphire almost certainly from Sri Lanka. This is anked by two small octahedral diamond 2 T he Ancient World crystals diamonds in their natural form. Despite the Indian origin for the diamonds and the likely Sri Lankan origin for the pink sapphire the A Khanoum ring is not in Indian style. It is a Greek type with early Hellenistic Greek ligree. The implication is that this ring was made by a Greek goldsmith working in A Khanoum and incorporating gems traded up from the south. However neither diamonds nor pink sapphires have been found so far in jewelry of such early date from the Mediterranean or Near East. In these areas the earliest evidence we have for diamonds is their use for the working of other gem materials. T his chapter will consider this early use of diamonds for what we might term industrial purposes and then trace the rst use of diamonds in jewelry in the Mediterranean world in Roman times. The Roman admiration of diamonds was served by their trade with India both overland and via the Indian Ocean until this was largely curtailed by the rise of Sasanian Persian power and then Islam. Diamond Chips in Lapidary Work Diamonds as we have seen can be broken into chips and splinters despite being extremely resistant to scratching in gemological terms diamonds are exceptionally hard but not tough. In the mid 1970s two Ame rican researchers Leonard Gorelick and John Gwinnett an orthodontist and a professor of oral biology and pathology respectively became intrigued by the drilling of stone beads in antiquity. They used the scanning electron microscope to study silicon rubber casts of the in terior of these drill holes and were able to establish the diagnostic appearance of various drill types. In particular they found perforations in ancient hard stone beads with identical characteristics to those produced by the hand operated diamo nd tipped drills st ill used in northern India Gorelick and Gwinnett 1988. The earliest evidence they found for diamond tipped drills w as from the Yemen dating from around the seventh to fth centuries BC Gwinnett and Gorelick 1991. In early times the Yemen was an important center of the coastal sea trade between India and the Red Sea so the beads may have been worked there or brought ready drilled from India. The br eaking of a diamond into usable chips required something hard and tough with which to hit or crush it. It might not be coincidence that the earliest evidence we have for diamond chips in lapidary work dates back to about the same time as the earliest steelthe so called wootz c rucible steel developed in India around 600 BC. From about this same period we have the earliest use of diamond chips for drilling beads in India tting in well with the Yemeni date Law et al. 2013 180. At about the time the Yemeni beads were made the prophet Jeremiah in Judah penned the often quoted biblical ve rse Your sin O Judah is written with a pen of iron and or perhaps with the point of a diamond Jeremiah 171. The word translated here as diamond is the Hebrew shamyr a word then applied to materials where hardness rather than sharpness was implied. Thus Zechariah described hearts being made like shamyr Zechariah 712. Shamyr might have included the abrasive emery and is probably the origin of the Greek word for emery smyris  but it is tempting to compare Jeremiahs pen of iron with the point of a diamond as used to engrave a stone tablet with the iron stylus with the diamond set tip tha t the Roman writer Pliny later described for engraving gemstones. Similar instruments were used by Mughal Indian lapidaries and Chinese jade workers and are still used today by engravers of precious stones. The implement held aloft by the man in gure 1.10 is probably intended as a diamond tipped lapida ry tool. Around the time the Roman writer Pliny died in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 the Roman poet Publius Papinius Statius began to write his twelve book ep ic the Thebaid which recounted the story of Oedipuss sons battle for the throne of T hebes. This complex Latin text includes an unclear description of an ornament incorporating emeralds and somehow set or decorated with percussum adamanta guras bk. 277. Percussum comes from the verb percutio typically meaning to beat or strike like the modern percussion so one reading might be that the emeralds were engraved with gures using broken chips of adamas. If so this ties in with Plinys mention of the lapidary use of diamonds. T here is no evidence for the use of the diamond as a gem in biblical times and accepting that the second row of gems in the Jewish high priests breastplate as described in the book of Exodus 28 18 included  an emerald a sapphire and a diamond is greeted with greater skepticism today than when stated in the King James translation of the Bible published at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Diamonds in the Greek World When we look to the Greek world our understanding of early acquaintance with diamond is hampered again by translation problems. The Greeks applied the word adamas meaning unconquerable or unalterable to substances characterized by their great hardness perhaps including early steel. In the fourth century BC the Greek philosopher Plato mentioned adamas twice. He refers to the precious substances which are mixed with the gold and akin to it and can be removed only by re copper silver and sometimes adamas  and says the o shoot of gold excessively hardened and dark colored by reason of its density has been called adamas Plato Politicos 303e Plato Timaeus 59b. Diamonds are found with gold but this is rare and it is more probable that Plato was describing the very hard natural alloy grains of members of the platinum family of metals typically osmium and iridium as are common in alluvial water borne gold deposits. Most ancient methods of gold recovery and treatment did not remove these little grains and so they can be seen as silvery gray specks in a s ignicant proportion of ancient gold objects gure 2.2. A few centuries later the Roman author Gaius Plinius Secundus AD 2379 known as Pliny the Elder or usually just Pliny described these same adamas grains found with gold with remarkable accuracy see below. T he well dened thin lines we begin to see in Greek engraved gems from around the late sixth century onwardfor example indicating lyre strings or chariot horses r einsare likely candidates for the use of a diamond point in engraving. Also from about this time onward some of the better quality Gr eek intaglios show traces of ne scratched lines used to lay out the design almost certainly produced with a diamond point. The American gem specialist George Kunz came to a similar conclusion It is possible that the stone diamond was employed in engraving in the fth century BC Kunz 1913 294. In the latter part of the fourth century BC Alexander the Great of Macedon embarked on his conquest of the Persian empire which took him at least as far east as the Indus. In the wake of Alexanders expedition pearls from the Persian Gulf emeralds from Egypts Eastern Desert and garnets from India began to reach the Hellenistic Greek world in increasing numbers to be set in gold jewelry. The inuence of Alexander the Greats expeditions and conquests on the trade in gems from India is reected in the ancient legend of Alexander the Great and the Valley of Gems a myth that as we will see resonated through history reappearing in various guises and with various other proponents from Sinbad to Marco Polo. A couple of centuries after Alexander development of direct rather than coastal sea trade with India began made possible by the exploitation of the monsoon winds. The Greek historian Strabo attributed this navigational discovery to the navigator Eudoxus of Cyzicus who explored the Indian Ocean for the Egyptian pharaoh Ptolemy VIII ca. 182116 BC and who indeed returned from his voyage to India with precious stones although he doesnt specically mention diamonds Strabo Geography 2.3.4. Indeed despite Egypts important position on the sea route east I am not aware of any mention of diamonds in Egyptian texts from this period. The Arabist and explorer Sir Richard Burton in his translation of the Arabian Nights says that according to Athanaeus of Naucratis in his Deipnosophistae The Indians brought pearls and diamonds to the procession of Ptolemy Philadelphus Burton 188588 9325. This was the great procession of Ptolemy II in 258 BC but I have been unable to nd any specic mention of diamonds or pearls in the original text although there are more general references to precious stones. T heophrastus a Greek philosopher from the island of Lesbos was a friend of one of Alexander the Greats generals perhaps of Alexander himself. Around 300 BC he wrote a book titled On Stones in which he mentions a substance named adamas Theophrastus De lapidibus 19. Unfortunately this mention is short and oblique. He seems to cite similarities between what he calls anthrax and adamas in their angular form or their resistance to heat or both of these. Possibly here anthrax was the lapidary abrasive emery and if so his adamas might have applied to diamond chips used in lapidary work. There is no clear indication that Theophrastus considered adamas to be a gemstone nor does he say that adamas came from India. T he early Roman poet Ovid 43 BCAD 1718 continued the Greek practice of applying the term adamas to hard and mythical materials. For example the chain holding the ferocious three headed d og of the underworld Cerberus was of adamant and Zeus chang ed Celmis into adamas when he o ended Rhea the mother of the gods  Meta morphoses 4.281 7.412. However there must have been a growing awareness of what we would recognize as diamond. Plinys Adamas When Julius Caesar defeated Mark Anthony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC the Roman destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms established by Alexander the Great three centuries earlier was complete. With Roman trade connections growing alongside the Roman love of luxuries it is hardly surpr ising that the earliest surviving examples of diamonds we have so far in jewelry in the European and Mediterranean worlds are from this period. The earliest Roman mention of a true diamond I am aware of is by the poet and astrologer Marcus Manilius in the early rst century AD. He explained that diamond a stone speck  punctum  is more precious than gold  Astronomica 4.926. Perhaps he was talking about diamond points for stone working rather than set in jewelry but from just a few decades later we have the comprehensive description written by Pliny a Roman naval and military commander as well as a natural historian of considerable ability. He wrote thirty seven bo oks on natural history the nal volume of which dealt with gemstones. In this work which became the standard text on gems for a millennium he explains The most highly valued of human possessions let alone gemstones is the adamas which for long was known only to kings and to very few of them Pliny Natural History 37.15. Again this is a clear indication that diamonds were considered gems since kings are unlikely to have coveted gem working tools . Plinys description of adamas is extensive and drawn from various sources. He describes six varieties of adamas just two of which were true adamas the most highly valued of human possessions. The rst of these was the Indian adamas that resembled rock crystal. It was transparent had smooth faces meeting at six corners and tapered to a point in two opposite directionsa good description of a typical octahedral diamond crystal. Such a crystal he says could be as large as a hazelnut. He describes the shape as like two whorls base to base perhaps an echo here of the comment in the Indian Arthasstra that the best diamond crystals could spin like a top. Plinys second true adamas was the Arabian similar to the Indian but smaller. The Roman province of Arabia included a whole swathe of the Near East incorporating what are now Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine and Syria thus straddling the main overland trading centers for goods from the East. It is possible that Plinys smaller diamonds represented the little Indian diamonds that formed part of the overland Arab trade rather than large ones that reached the Roman world as a result of the then blossoming direct sea trade with India. Another possibility is that Plinys smaller diamonds were the little chips and splinters of diamond for lapidary purposes that for centuries had been brought from India by Arab traders. T he other four types of adamas that Pliny describes were of silvery color and found with goldan occurrence noted earlier by Plato. Pliny tells us that ancient authorities thought the only examples of adamas were the small pale seed like grains found in the Ethiopian gold mines and called the knot of gold. However by Plinys time there was also cenchros Greek for millet seed which it resembled in size the Macedonian adamas of cucumber seed size found in th e gold mines of Philippi and a more coppery colored ada mas from Cyprus. Pliny also tacks on siderites which shone like iron and was heavier than the other varieties but concludes that neither the Cyprian adamas nor siderites were really worthy of the name adamas. The goldmine adamas sound very much like the silvery platinum metal grains noted above as frequent associates of gold Ogden 1977.1 Plinys statements that adamas was so tough that it could not be hammered without risk of the hammer splitting and that it conquered re have drawn considerable derision in more recent years. Both statements are untrue of diamond. However a careful reading of Plinys original text suggests that he was attributing these properties to the gold mine adama s only. The silvery platinum group metal g rains so commonly found with gold and ubiquitous as inclusions in ancient gold objects see f igure 2.2 are typically mixtures of iridium osmium and often ruthenium Ogden 1977. Such grains are among the hardest natural mineral products in the world and still almost impossible to atten mechanically. Their melting temperatures can be more than double those attained in iron production furnaces. Plinys seemingly preposterous statement that if a magnet is moved towards the iron and seizes it the adamas snatches the iron and takes it away bears a remarkable resemblance to metallurgist Ernest Smiths statement two millennia later that some platinum metal grains from the Urals in Russia attract iron lings more powerfully than an ordinary magnet Ogden 1977 Smith 1947 458. The description of the platinum metal grains in gold as adamas continued into medieval times in his Best Thoughts on the Best of Stones the Arab poet and author Ahmad al Tifashi died 1253 no ted that those working gold were aware of the specks of almas the Arabic equivalent of the Greek adamas  that could be embedded in it and spoil it Abul Huda 1998 119. For some fteen hundred years Pliny seems to have been misunderstood and diamonds continued to be described as resistant to hammering and re and magnetic. The 1491 Hortus Sanitatis illustration in gure 1.10 shows diamonds resisting the heat of a roaring re. Roman Diamond Set Jewelr y Pliny lived at a time of expanding trade connections with the East. The traditional trade routes had been overland the same trails that Alexander and his armies had trodden or via various intermediaries in the coastal trade round Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The discovery of the navigational benets of the monsoons in the second century BC allowed direct trade from the Red Sea to India further facilitated when in 26 BC the Romans subdued the Yemeni trade competition. Soon according to the Greek geographer Strabo 120 ships set out from Egypt on the trip to India each year sailing with the monsoon Strabo Geography 2.5.12. A century later an anonymous Greek speaking merchant in luxury goods living at the trading port of Berenike Troglodytica on the Red Sea coast wrote a handbook on the sea trade from the Red Sea down the east African coast and across the Indian Ocean. Among the trade goods that he says could be obtained from southwest Indian ports were all kinds of precious stones including adamas which came from the ports of Muziris and Nelkynda both probably in Kerala southern India Casson 1989 8485 223. The arrival of diamonds t for jewelry in the Roman world was probably a direct result of this large scale two way luxury t rade with India instigated in Roman times. Nevertheless there appears to be no conrmed surviving diamond set jewelr y found in the Mediterranean world from Plinys time. T here have been some proposed early Roman diamonds. T he British Museum possesses a Roman bronze statuette in an archaizing Greek style dating to between the rst century BC and the rst century AD obtained from the jeweler Castellani in Rome in 1873. This has eyes set with small diamonds which have often been cited as an early Roman use of the gem. A study in 1953 showed that the little stones were indeed diamonds but were of rose like cut and bor e a resemblance to those used sometimes in watch bearings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The eye sockets also revealed signs of modern interference and the conclusion was that the diamonds were a relatively recent embellishment to the piece Grodzinski 1953a. Another possible use of diamond eyes needs corroboration. The eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 that killed the inquisitive Pliny also killed a female slave whose recently found body was wearing a massive gold snake bracelet or armlet inscribed to show it had been given to her by her master. Press reports have said that the eye inlays are small diamonds although to my knowledge this has not been conrmed gemologically Johnston 2000. If these are indeed diamonds this bracelet would be the earliest known piece of diamond set Roman jew elry. T he New Testament book of Revelation generally accepted as being written in the nal quarter of the rst century AD refers to the walls of Jerusalem as garnished with all manner of precious stones Revelation 21 1920. Th e twelve gems listed similar but not identical to those in the high priests breastplate do not include diamond. One might imagine that if diamonds were then widely familiar as a valuable gem they would have been included. Nevertheless Roman diamond set jew elry and mentions of it became commoner with time. In one of his epigrams the poet Martial commented that the Roman senator and fellow poet Lucius Arruntius Stella ourished ca. AD 100 wore rings of sardonyxes emeralds diamonds and jasper on a single ngerpaid for by his poetry skills Ker 1919 1303  Martial Epigrams 5.11. A few years later a possibly ctional diamond made precious by the nger of Berenike was described by the Roman poet and satirist Juvenal as having been bought from a merchant near the Portico of Agrippa in Rome at the December feast of the Sigillaria Ramsay 1928 9495  Satire 6.156. This Berenike was not one of the earlier Egyptian queens so named but the sister to and allegedly lover of King Herod Agrippa II. Indeed Juvenal says that this ring was given as a present long ago by the barbarian Agrippa to his incestuous sister. Juvenals readers no doubt understood that then as now there was a commercial premium for a jewel provenance both royal and salacious. T he Roman historian Cassius Dio recorded in his Historia Romana that the Roman emp eror Augustus presented his adopted son Agrippa initially also his heir with his ring Cary and Foster 1917 6271  Cassius Dio 53.30.2. There is no mention of this being diamond but in AD 97 the Roman emperor Nerva continued the tradition and presented his ring to his successor the man who would become the emperor Trajan Magie 1921 811  Historia Augusta 1.3.7. This ring is said to have been a diamond although this report is found in the Historia Augusta a work compiled later in the Roman period and of debatable accuracy. A generation later this same ring was passed on to Trajans adopted successor Hadrian Magie 1921 811  Historia Augusta 137. It was about this time that Dionysius PeriegetesDionysius the Travelerwrote a description of the world and mentioned sparkling diamonds     from Southern India Bernhardy 1828 307 line 7. A few generations later the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy ca. AD 90168 was more specic explaining that the diamond mines in India were controlled by the Sabarai tribe possibly deriving this information from the description of diamonds from Sabhrra in the Indian Ar thasstra. We have no text of Ptolemys Geograph y earlier than medieval copies but this possible equation of Ptolemys Sabarai with Sabhrra adds credibility to the diamond mention being ancient. T he little diamond set rin g in gure 2.3 was buried with a girl near Rome. She was born in about AD 150 and died while still in her teens Bedini et al. 2012. The style of burial has been linked to the Syrian community in Rome and it is worth noting that this was the time of the military expedition of Roman emperor Lucius Verus to Syria and the East AD 163 that helped to stimulate the trade in Eastern products to Rome. This little diamond is in its natural octahedral crystal form since diamond could then be neither cut nor polished. It weighs about 0.15 carats and extends through the mount and would have touched the nger. If later practice is anything to go by this contact may have been intentional allowing the supposed powers of the diamond to pass to the wearer.2 From the far west of the Roman empire near Granada in Spain we have a dedicatory inscription of the later second century AD on an elaborate marble base for a statue of the god dess Isis that lists the jewelry with which she was decked including two rings set with diamonds on her little nger. The French Benedictine monk Bernard de Montfaucon 16551741 who rst published this statue base noted that he had not previously encountered any mention of Roman diamond set jewelr y Montfaucon 1722 pl. 136 32425. A hundred years later in 1822 the mineralogist Delvalle Varley was seemingly the rst to note a surviving Roman diamond set rin g one by then already in the British Museum but her friend commented that it was not a very elegant ornament Varley 1822 222627. Most of the surviving Roman diamond rings date from the second half of the third century and perhaps into the fourth. At least ve published examples of these have stated provenances three coming from Syria two from Italy. There are three further diamond set rin gs formerly in the Castellani Collection without provenance now in the British Museum. One appears to be non ancient but the t wo others are probably from Italy since a major proportion of the objects obtained by the British Museum from the Castellani Collection in 1872 were Italian f inds. One of these British Museum rings is perhaps the one that the nineteenth century Italian jew eler Augusto Castellani referred to as A Roman ring of the Imperial epoch in which a beautiful hexahedral diamond is set in its natural state weighing about one carat Castellani 1871 79. Castellani also refers to a diamond set Roman r ing that had belonged to Hertz presumably the London based Ger man gem and art dealer Abraham Bram Hertz. T he three Syrian examples are said to be from around Tartus. One of these is the gold ring set with a diamond shown in gure 2.4. This was formerly in the collection of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks and is now in the British Museum Marshall 1907 no. 785. The collection formed by Louis de Clercq 18361901 a French photographer and collector of antiquities who spent some time in Syria included a gold ring from Tartus set with an octahedral diamond weighing about 1.65 carats gure 2.5 previously described as a pointed topaz and the gold ring set with a large brown diamond previously described as an irregular topaz see gure 1.5 Ridder 1911 nos. 2061 and 2065 Hindman et al. 2014 2068. The large uncut brown diamond is in the form of interpenetrate twins and weighs about 7 carats the ring is described as coming from Amrit just a few miles from the city of Tartus Ogden 1973b Ogden 1982 pl. 29. The rst of the two rings from Italy is a gold ring set with what is probably an octahedral diamond now in the Louvre in Paris and which was formerly in the Campana Collection and said to be from Rome Ridder 1924 no. 1164. The second is in the British Museum formerly in the Franks collection and is set with what appears to be an octahedral diamond and said to have been found in SantAngelo dei Lombardi in Campania Italy Marshall 1907 no. 846. This is set with what is called a pyramidal yellow crystal. There are various other later Roman gold rings without provenance in museum and private collec tions and a few fakes. All the diamonds in Roman rings are used in their natural uncut state. In most cases the Roman rings are set with one rarely two diamonds but a ring now in the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen is set with a diamond octahedron and a cabochon emerald gure 2.6 also Hindman et al. 2014 209. T he only Roman gold object other than a ring set with diamonds of which I am aware is the gold seal in gure 2.7 formerly in the Castellani Collection said to have been found in Rome Marshall 1907 no. 2954. This is a curious and I suspect composite object not unique in the Castellani Collection. The black onyx with its intaglio monogram and the base of the object in which this is set are probably nineteenth century. The two gem set components that rise from it are probably reused later R oman components but what they derive from is unclear. One of these is set with a small but ne quality na tural diamond octahedron of about 0.2 carats the other with a conical garnet of typical Late Roman form. There appears to have been a third vertical element originally now missing. T he clusters of later Roman diamond rings in Italy and Syria are not unexpected. Rome was the center of the Roman empire a huge concentration of wealth with an endless desire for conspicuous consumption. Syria lay at the end of the trade routes from India to the Mediterranean and indeed Aleppo in Syria continued to be a major trading center for Indian luxury goods including diamonds into the seventeenth century. Further west in Europe Roman peri od diamonds are elusive although the two diamond rings described on the statue of Isis in Spain mentioned above show that they were not unknown there. A ring found near the major Roman city of Trier in Germany was illustrated and listed by the German archaeologist Friedrich Henkel in his comprehensive catalogue of Roman rings from the Rhineland Henkel 1913 no. 1812 36  The Ancient World1164 2 pl. 67. Henkel describes the gem as water white but notes Whether this is a rock crystal or a diamond cannot be determined without detailed investigation. The best that can be gleaned from his small photo is that the ring is in the Late Roman style of the diamond set rin gs from Syria and the little stone appears to be of a pyramid shape. Diamond seems likely. T he present whereabouts of this ring are unknown. There are fewer surviving Roman gold rings set with colorless rock crystal than with diamonds and even some of those are cut into octahedra presumably as deliberate imitations of diamond as in the Late Roman gold ring set with what is now a rather worn octahedra of rock crystal in gure 2.8 Ogden 1973a. Diamonds in the Early Byzantine World In AD 324 the emperor Constantine founded Constantinople as his new eastern capital heralding what is referred to as the Early Byzantine period. To my knowledge there are no surviving diamonds from this time and no documentary references to specic examples. Most of our information comes from the musings of the early Christian writers. They tend to repeat Pliny cite Jeremiahs diamond tipped stylus and link th e exceptional hardness of diamond with such Christian virtues as the strength of the human soul. Perhaps the most objective mention of diamond is by Augustine of Hippo later St. Augustine AD 354430 who notes The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves especially by jewelers and lapidaries and the stone is so hard that it can be wrought neither by iron nor re nor they say by anything at all except goats blood. But do you suppose it is as much admired by those who own it and are familiar with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for the rst time Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not believe what is said of it or if they do they wonder as Figure 2.4.  opposite top  Roman gold ring from Tartus Syria set with an octahedral diamond third century AD.

The allegorical potential for diamonds was not limited to early Christianity. In India the so called Diamond Sutra a Buddhist text dating back at least as far as the rst few centuries AD tells us little about diamonds other than that the teachings of Buddha will cut like a diamond blade through worldly illusion.

Maurus Servius Honoratus at the end of the fourth century AD felt it necessary to explain to readers of Virgil that diamond was a hard and solid stone that resisted iron and could only be broken using goats blood. In contrast his contemporary Augustine of Hippo seems to have expected his readers to possess such knowledge of the natural world because it was needed in order to understand the allusions in the Bible in regard to minerals and plants knowledge of the garnet for instance which shines in the dark throws light upon many of the dark places in books too where it is used metaphorically and ignorance of the beryl or the diamond often shuts the doors of knowledge St. Augustine On Christian Doctrine 2.15. This passage places diamond rmly within the context of other gemstones but may simply echo Pliny rather than indicate any signicant use of diamonds in jewelry in Augustines day. One of Augustines contemporaries St. Epiphanius Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus wrote a commentary on the twelve stones of the Jewish high priests breastplate Blake and de Vis 1934. He makes no mention of diamond but surely would have done so if it had been a highly esteemed gemstone in his day. A couple of centuries later Isidore Bishop of Seville dismissed diamond as Figure 2.8. Late Roman diamond ring set with an octahedron of rock crystal imitating diamond. Credit Private collection. Photo Jack Ogden. a small unsightly stone from India fragments of which were used for engraving and perforating gemstones Barney et al. 2006 32526. T he lack of diamonds in Early Byzantine jewelry can be explained partly by a signicant reduction in if not cessation of trade between the Mediterranean world and India. The overland trade and the maritime trade around Arabia were largely blocked by the expansion of the Sasanian Persian empire after the third century AD. Initially perhaps just the coastal and more northerly trade routes were a ected since surviving Early Byzantine jewelry clearly demonstrates that the pale blue sapphires from Sri Lanka Ceylon had become relatively abundant. A switch in focus from India to Sri Lanka is supported by nds of Sri Lankan sapphires at Egyptian sites on the Red T he Ancient World  39Sea Wendrich et al. 2003 62. Even this trade faded later since it appears that the important port of Berenike on the Red Sea the base of the writer of the Periplus was gradually abandoned during the sixth century AD Sidebotham and Wendrich 1999. Diamonds as a Lapidary Polish In the early third century AD Gaius Julius Solinus a geographer and linguist about whom little is known mentions diamonds from India in his De mirabilibus mundi The wonders of the world and comments that sapphire although hard could be engraved with a diamond Mommsen 1895 136 19394. By Solinuss time diamond chips had been used to engrave and drill other gem materials for the best part of a millennium but ancient use of nely ground diamond powder to polish gems is less easy to demonstrate that early. Diamond can only be cut or polished with diamond and so lapidary use of diamond powder was a necessary prerequisite for the development of diamond cutting. The diamonds set in ancient jewelry are all in their natural form with no evidence of polishing but sapphire second only to diamond in hardness was being polished by the third century BC. The pink sapphire in the ring from A Khanoum see gure 2.1 is an early example. However the ability to polish sapphire does not necessarily imply the use of diamond dust as an abrasive. The eleventh century Pe rsian scholar al Brn although probably the rst to specically mention grinding diamond to powder notes that the surface of a ruby the same mineral species as sapphire and of equal hardness is made uniform and smooth with the emery but admits that this might take a month of polishing Said 1989 40. Even use of emery was not essential for a ne polish. Sapphires have traditionally been polished using tin oxide which although far softer than sapphire acts by causing some sort of localized sur40  The Ancient Worldface ow perhaps related to the Beilby layer an amorphous layer formed on the surface of metals during polishing. This concept has been rejected by much of the scientic community but experienced gem cutters say they make use of it on a day to day basis Crowcroft 1981 Harrington 2011. Recent research has shown that a similar surface layer may be produced in diamond polishing Grillo and Field 1997 Pastewka et al. 2011. T he sharp edges on some later Roman and Early Byzantine sapphire beads are the strongest evidence yet for diamond powder being employed but further research is needed to substantiate this. It seems probable that the sapphires used in Roman and Early Byzantine jewelry were imported as ready worked gems or be ads and perhaps diamond powder was employed by gem workers in India for several centuries before the practice was known further west. To date there appears to be no certain evidence that diamond dust was being used as a lapidary polish in Europe or the Near East until medieval times. T he early history of diamonds clearly reveals their origin in India and transport to the Mediterranean world with initial use as sharp chips for drilling or engraving other gem materials. The earliest use of diamonds in jewelry so far known appears to be in northern India and up into Afghanistan. This was the time following Alexander the Greats military campaigns that stretched into this area and the resulting Hellenic inuence so it is hardly surprising that rumors of these extraordinary gems t only for kings reached the Mediterranean world. Diamonds then became an article of trade albeit a rare one in Roman times the overland trade route reected in the cluster of Roman peri od diamond rings found in Syria. The trade continued into Early Byzantine times but then the actions of the Sasanian Persians and the rise of Islam seemingly cast Europe and the Mediterranean world into some ve centuries of a diamond dark age. T he Ancient World  41I n this chapter we will look at diamonds and their use in ancient jewelry to the lands east of the Mediterranean in Persia and across to India itself. That the earliest surviving diamond rings such as the one in gure 2.1 come from Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent is not surprising since India was the main if not the only diamond source then known. An Indian Sanskrit manuscript called the Arthasstra The lesson of prot provides early evidence for diamonds being considered as gems. It has been supposed that this work was written by Kau ilya a minister to the emperor Chandragupta under the Mauryan dynasty in northern India 3 Early Persia and the East around 300 BC but the dating of the text has been debated. Recent study by Patrick Olivelle a scholar of Sanskrit literature suggests that it was actually compiled in phases between about the later second century BC and the late third or fourth century AD Olivelle 2013 2528. The section devoted to diamonds includes a note on the sources of diamond their colors and their ideal form Diamonds come from Sabhrra Tajjamrra Kstrarra  Srkaana Man  imanta and Indravna Olivelle 2013 12324. Olivelle says that any attempt to identify these places is just guesswork 2013 531. However an association of Sabhrra with the Indian diamond mines controlled by the Sabarai tribe seemingly noted by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy as mentioned earlier is tempting. T he list of diamond colors given in the Arthasstra includes cats eye  Sira ower cows urine cows fat clear crystal Ml ower and then adds any other gem color which is little help to us but it does say that the best diamonds were large See gure 3.8. 43Figure 3.1.

Photo Jack Ogden. 44  Early Persia and the East heavy and hard had symmetrical points could scratch a vessel would spin like a top and sparkled brightly. On the other hand a diamond lacking points or edges or with a defective side was inferior. This text reveals a high level of sophistication in the appreciation of diamond and is the earliest acknowledgment we have that complete ne crystals were more cherished than broken ones. There is also mention of mining in pits and from streams suggesting that diamond mining was by no means an insignicant operation. At Jonnagiri in southern India there are rock carved edic ts of the emperor Ashoka ruled ca. 268232 BC that are said to refer to the diamonds and gold found there Panjikar and Ramchandran 2005.T he diamond ring in gure 2.1 is not unique among nds from the Indian periphery of the Greek world. A simpler ring in a private collection also with a pink sapphire anked by two diamond crystals was found in a Buddhist reliquary in the Taxila region of what is now Pakistan in a small cylindrical gold box together with emerald and sapphire beads plus a copper alloy coin of the Mauryan period circa the third century BC gure 3.1. A detail of one of the anking diamonds is shown in gure 3.2. A magnicent gold ring set with an octahedral diamond crystal now in the al Sabah collecti on in Kuwait gure 3.3 bears an inscription in Kharo h a script current in Afghanistan and Pakistan between about the third century BC and the fourth century AD. This has been dated to around the rst century BC and described as Indo Parthian C arter and Freeman 2013 154 no. 78. A very similar ring said to be from Pakistan was recently seen on the London market. The gold ring in gure 3.4 is also said to have been found in Afghanistan or Pakistan and was formerly in the Jrgen and Gudrun Abeler collection now in the Yevdayev collection Spier and Ogden 2015 5455. T his is set with two small uncut octahedral diamonds on very high rounded shoulders anking a green chalcedony. I previously dated this to contemporary with the Roman period but the form with two diamonds anking a central colored gem may tie it in with rings such as those in gures 2.1 and 3.1 and perhaps an earlier date is probable.Sasanian Between AD 224 and 651 a huge swathe of land encompassing the regions between the Arabian Gulf the Black Sea Afghanistan and for a time as far west as the eastern shores of the Mediterranean was ruled by the Sasanian dynasty of Persia. During the reign of the second Sasanian emperor Shapur I AD 240270 Sasanian inuence was extended further into northern India. This is a time when we might expect to nd diamonds in Sasanian jewelry but the evidence is elusive. Shapur himself is said to have invaded Roman territory in AD 258 wearing a diamond studded apro n Ragozin and Benjamin 1889 206 Brose 1954. However I have been unable to trace the original source of this story. It is also reported that the governor of Ormus on the Persian Gulf purchased expensive diamonds for Shapur Is son Hormizd I and told him that if he Figure 3.4. Gold ring set with central green chalcedony and f lanked by small octahedral diamonds from Afghanistan or Pakistan. Photo Slava Yevdayev. Early Persia and the East  47didnt want them he could easily sell them for a good prot. Hormizd supposedly replied that the money was unimportant but if he meddled in trade who would act as king Farr 1850 28081 Unfortunately I have not been able to nd the original source of this account either. Although magnicent Sasanian silver objects are well known surviving gold jewelry is rare. The main exceptions are rings and these are typically set with intaglio gems that could function as seals. These gems are usually opaque stones such as orangey red carnelian and agates with some transparent red garnets. A simple ring set with an octahedral diamond said to have been found in Pakistan may be of the Sasanian period Bopearachchi Landes et al. 2003 327 no. 284. The form and construction is comparable with rings of the Late Roman period although a somewhat similar ring from Southeast Asia perhaps Vietnam has been dated to the ninth century AD Bari and Sautter 2001 314. T he later Arab historian and geographer al Mas d said that the Sasanian ruler Kosrau II Parvs AD 591628 owned a ring set with a seal of which the bezel was red jqt ruby or pink sapphire. Its engraving was a portrait of the king and round it was inscribed the titulature of the king. Its ring was alms.  Alms is diamond but a hoop of diamond is highly unlikely as Adrian Bivar emeritus professor of Iranian studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies London pointed out Bivar 1969 33. A hoop set with diamonds is possible or perhaps if the ring is not fanciful there was a circle of small diamonds around the jqt. Early Islam During the seventh century the Sasanian empire was conquered by the expanding forces of Islam and from this period until 48  Early Persia and the Eastthe eleventh century we nd almost no Eastern gemstones in surviving Islamic jewelry Spink and Ogden 2013. For information on diamonds we now have to turn to documentary sources including the growing class of ction. The most familiar of the latter is the Kitb alf laylah wa laylah be tter known in the west as One Thousand and One Nights a compilation of stories adapted and supplemented over the centuries but with many of its roots in Islamic literature of the ninth and tenth centuries AD. Its stories include many allusions to diamonds and other gems. In them we can see something even if exaggerated of the great wealth of Baghdad a city founded as the capital of the Abbasid Islamic caliphate in AD 762. A glimpse of this Arab trade might be seen in the Sanskrit Dashakumaracharita probably of the sixth to eighth centuries AD which refers to a diamond of immense value that could be obtained from a Yavana trader named Khanati Chandra 1977 235. There has been debate over the identity of the Yavana the consensus seems to be Arab or Persian although Alexandrian has also been suggested Das 1980 332 Chandra 1977 130. Certainly by the tenth century Arab merchants were to be found from Africa well south of the equator to as far east as China. Early Jewish involvement in the trade is less easy to demonstrate. Gedalia Yogev has said that the Jewish brothers Abu Sa d al Tustar and Abu Nas r al Tustar were inuential bankers and diamond merchants in the 11th century at Cairo but doesnt provide a reference Yogev 1975 158. Perhaps surprisingly there is no mention of diamonds in Shelomo Goitein and Mordechai Friedmans list of seventy seven commodities traded from or through India taken from the medieval J ewish Geniza records from Cairo Goitein and Friedman 2008 1516. Pearls and beads are included in one case a single shipment of 95000 beads Goitein and Friedman 2008 190. The so called Krim Arab me rchants were the main players in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea trade in medieval Early Persia and the East  49times dealing in commodities such as spices silks and slaves and some had ourishing operations in India particularly at Calicut now known as Kozhikode on the Kerala coast. With the rise of the Mamluks in Egypt and the expulsion of the Jews from trade Krim merchants including diamond traders took their place Wiet 1955. Their name may have derived from the Tamil karyam which meant business Goitein 1968 360. One of the earliest extant Arabic texts on gems is the Kitab khawas al jawhir The book on the properties of precious gems written by the Iraqi polymath Yaqb ibn Ishq al Kind who died circa AD 873. This work a major source for al Brn and other later medieval Islamic writers is often stated to be lost but there is a ninth century copy in the National Library and Archives of Egypt in Cairo. It is divided into twenty ve chapters and after a general introduction describes the properties of di erent gemstones including diamonds. Kindi explains that the best type of diamond displays varied colors like a rainbowan early mention of diamonds play of colors or dispersion. He also notes that he had never seen a stone larger than a pine nut Said 1989 80. 1 Another text probably also originally compiled in the ninth century is De Lapidibus of the so called Pseudo Aristotle pos sibly of Persian or Syrian origin Ruska 1912 Thorndike 1922. This work like many other medieval texts was attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Here the description of diamond lies ninth down the list of minerals after pearl emerald sapphire garnet carnelian onyx malachite and bezoar stone. Diamond it says is the color of s al ammoniac that is white to colorless Ruska 1912 14950. It can be pulverized with the help of lead and particles can then be xed on an iron point and used to drill other gems such as pearl sapphire and emerald. A diamond chip mounted on the end of a wire can also be used to remove a stone in the bladder by insertion up the urethra God willing. 50  Early Persia and the EastT his dangerous intrusive and extremely painful operation is mentioned by several Islamic and European writers. One of the latter was the Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orta in the sixteenth century who explained that the procedure was used by Indians Markham 1913 343. In the section on diamond in De Lapidibus there is no specic mention of its use for ornamental purposes and not all the stones in this section are gemstones. Diamond is followed by emery where it is noted that this stone is mixed with shellac the resinous secretions from the lac insect and used to polish other gemsperhaps an early mention of the traditional Indian emery impregna ted lac polishing wheel Ruska 1912 15051. There is no mention of diamond powder as a lapidary polish. De Lapidibus also explains that diamonds were found in a snake lled valley in the far eastern reaches of Khorasan where only Alexander had ventured. In keeping with the pretense that the writer was Aristotle the writer rather enchantingly refers to Alexander as my pupil. In order to retrieve the diamonds without having to encounter the snakes the locals threw meat into the valley. Birds would pick up the meat with diamonds adhering and the gems would be retrieved by a visit to the birds nests. Diamond shouldnt be put in the mouth for one it would damage the teeth and second it might retain traces of snake venom that could kill. The Valley of Gems had already been part of folklore for several centuries but the snakes do not seem to have been a part of these stories until the time of De Lapidibus and thereafter became staple accompaniments as we see in a representation in a Turkish manuscript of circa 1582 gure 3.5. De Lapidibus also made Alexander the Great in Arabic Iskander the hero although the Valley of Gems does not seem to have become part of the popular Romance of Alexander stories until the twelfth century Laufer 1915 1011.

Purchased from Demotte and Company 1935.A century or so after the De Lapidibus account the Persian scholar and traveler Ab al Rayhn Muhammad ibn Ahmad a l Brn 9731048 retold the stor y in greater detail Another story is that of diamonds in a cave which is not accessible to men. Therefore they throw fresh meat into it the meat sticks to the diamonds. The many vultures and hawks who are attracted to the cave on account of the meat thrown into it bring out the piece of esh from the cave. It is the habit of birds to shake o  the bits of earth and other impurities from their food before eating it. People then gather up the diamonds. There is also the familiar version in the One Thousand and One Nights or The Arabian Nights. A diamond valley full of perils and terrors but not specically serpents is part of the Second Voyage of Sinbad. Here once the birds have picked up the meat with the adhering diamonds the merchants come and shout at them and scare them away from the meat. Then they come and taking the diamonds which they nd sticking to it go their ways with them and leave the meat to the birds and beasts nor can any come at the diamonds but by this device Burton 188588 619. The Venetian merchant and traveler Marco Polo similarly located the diamonds in a deep valley impossible to retrieve because of the presence of serpents. In contrast to the ninth century De L apidibus al Brn in the eleventh century specically treated diamond as a gem material perhaps reecting a wider recognition of its use in jewelry by his time. For him the position of diamond among other gems was like that of a king among his subjects. He talks about diamond values noting that a diamond in one piece was worth much more than the same weight in fragments. Al Brn mentio ns one large diamond jewel sent by Muizz al Dawlah the f irst of the Buwayhid emirs of Iraq in the late tenth century to his brother Rukn al Dawlah. This jewel weighed three mithqals a little over sixty carats a hitherto unheard of size Said 1989 Early Persia and the East  5380. He also notes a ring with a diamond the size of a grape that had supposedly been owned by the central Asian Samanid ruler Nuh bin Mansur Samani in the later tenth century Said 1989 56. Generally however diamonds seem to have found more use in jewelry in India than further west. Early India Al Brn note s The people of Iraq and Khurasan do not disting uish between the di erent kinds of diamonds or their colors. All diamonds are alike in their eyes as they use them for drilling and for creating poison. They do not venerate the diamond like the Indians do. In India di erent colors of diamond were linked to di erent castes and considered suitable for di erent types of ornament If it appears white it is of the f iner kind. It is then used for the adornment of swords necklaces and all other jewelry that is used to adorn the upper part of the body. If it appears red it should be suitable for the jewelry worn in the middle of the body. If exhibiting yellow color it is suitable for use in bracelets rings armlets etc. The black kind is suitable for ornaments of the feet Said 1989 76. T he rarity of surviving diamond set jewelr y from pre Mughal India is surprising since early Indian texts make it evident that diamond set ornaments were not uncommon. For example a diamond set anklet pla ys a leading role in the Tamil classic Shilappadikaram believed to have been composed in the early centuries AD. It is described as being of pure and beautifully worked gold set with rubies and diamonds Krishnamoorthy 2011. The reality of the established gem and jewelry market described in the Shilappadikaram is indicated by the taxation and commercial information given in the Arthasstra and the precise information relating to the qualities and defects of diamonds found in Indian gemological texts such as the Agasti54  Early Persia and the Eastmata and Ratnaparks. The latter text describes diamond and its qualities and tells us that kings should associate with excellent people just as the diamond is set together with the most costly gems. T he section of a gold earring probably from central India in gure 3.6 may give an idea of the type of jewelry described in the early texts. Here there are both octahedral diamonds and rock crystal imitations. This is now in the al Sabah Collecti on in Kuwait and has been dated to around the rst century BC to the second century AD Keene 2004 g. 9.

By medieval times in India diamonds seem to have been abundant in the higher levels of society but there are few survivals. A rare example is the ornament likely to be of around tenth to eleventh century da te shown in gure 3.7. This is said to have been found in north India and is now in a private collection. It is set with four highly glossy natural diamond crystals set on their sides to provide at upper surfaces. The other gems are a square cabochon emerald and two reused pink sapFigure 3.7.

The most likely date of this is around the tenth to eleventh centuries. It is also probably an ear decoration although gold ornaments of similar style and technique are known in medieval Java and have been described as vervels  that is rings for attachment to a hawks or pet birds leg Miksic 2011 116267. The style of setting of both these ornaments is reminiscent of that used later in Mughal Indian jewelry what is termed kundun setting using gold foil burnished down around the stones. T he relative abundancy of diamond set gold jewelry in medieval India is demonstrated by the inscriptions on the central shrine in the Tanjavur Temple far to the south in Tamil Nadu. T hese re cord gi fts of numerous diamond set or naments to the deities from Kundavai Pirttiyr a daughter of Parantaka Chola II reigned AD 957 970. One of several such objects was a gold girdle set with 667 large and small diamonds Hultzsch 1891 87 and passim. The diamonds in this and the other ornaments presented by her are described as including those with spots crack red dots black dots and marks as of burning. We can note that the gold ornament both all gold and gem set desc ribed in the Tanjavur Temple inscriptions have their weights given inclusive of the lacthat is their resin lling another characteristic of later kundun work. Most tantalizingly the diamonds listed in these temple inscriptions are categorized as diamond crystals smooth diamonds square diamonds with smooth edges at diamonds with smooth edges and round diamonds. Inevitably there is some uncertainty regarding translation of the Sanskrit terms but it is tempting to see in these descriptions evidence for some simple cutting or polishing of diamonds in India prior to European involvement in the regiona possibility to which we will return in Chapter 14. T he diamond set rin g shown in gures 3.8 and 3.9 and two others very like it but with diamonds anking central rubies or pink sapphires are said to be from Afghanistan or Pakistan. One bears an incised inscription on the inside of the hoop relating it to Mu izz Al Din Muhammad Bin Sam AD 1173120 6 one of the founders of Muslim rule in India. The diamonds are natural uncut but very glossy octahedra that again have been set on their sides giving an impression of a simple triangular table cut a type of sideways mounting for diamonds that became popular in Europe a century or two later.

Al Br ns eleventh cent ury remark that diamond was being intentionally ground to powder seemingly the earliest such mention must mean there was an end use for it and it seems unlikely that this was solely medicinal use or for poisoning. He does not specically refer to diamond powder for cutting gems but he does note that nephrite jade  yashm  from Turkistan was cut using diamond. This may have just meant the engraving and carving of nephrite with diamond chips rather than polishing. A Chinese text of around AD 1300 says The workers in jade polish jade by persevering application of river gravel and ca rve it by means of a diamond point Laufer 1915 31. However recent research has indicated that diamond may have been used to polish nephrite jade from a very early period in China Lu et al. 2005. Some diamonds are found in China and these may well have found some use for abrasives but there are also fth century AD Chinese r ecords of diamond set n ger rings being worn by foreigners and sent to China from India and in one case from Java Laufer 1915 50 Yule 1866 lxviii. A gold ring set with a small diamond crystal was excavated in 1970 in a tomb in Nanjing China dating to the fourth or fth century AD Tokyo 2012 cat. 103. The diamond from Java might be the earliest reference to diamonds from Borneo which was a source of diamond for the Chinese prior to European involvement there in the early seventeenth century Ogden 2005. Surviving early diamond set jewelr y may not be common from the Middle East and India but mentions of it in Persian and Arab sources and in Indian literature suggest that it was not as rare as the sparse nds suggest. Even as late as the thirteenth century the Persian writer Mohammed ben Man58  Early Persia and the Eastsur makes no mention of diamond cutting or polishing but he did note that diamonds were so highly esteemed in India that hitherto their export had been prohibited Hammer 1818 347. Such an export ban might help explain why diamonds were all but unknown in the medieval European and Islamic worlds prior to the thirteenth century. Early Persia and the East  59T he magnicent treasures of gold and gems found in Europe dating to the centuries following the decline of the Roman empire such as the Sutton Hoo and Staordshire Anglo Saxon gold work in Britain might belie the name Dark Ages often applied to this period. With diamonds however it is appropriate. For several centuries we hear little more of diamonds in Europe other than repeated myths and misunderstandings before trade through centers such as Aleppo and Alexandria brought these gems to Europe again. 4 Medieval Europe Trade with the East Links between the Orient and Europe didnt die out following the end of the Roman period. Within a century of the unknown ruler being placed in his ship burial along with spectacular regalia at Sutton Hoo in eastern Britain most of the Spanish peninsula was under Moslem rule. When a few generations later Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome in AD 800 he received an Indian elephant from the Baghdad based caliph Hrn ar Rash d delivered via North Africa. From about this same time we hear of Jewish merchants journeying between Europe and China and in the tenth century a trader from Spain expressed his surprise at the variety of Indian spices available at the market at Mainz Lunde and Stone 2012 passim. Even so there are few mentions of gems in connection with this commerce and no specic mention of Detail of gure 4.6. 61diamonds. It is still unclear what proportion of the garnets sapphires emeralds and other colored gems set in European religious objects and secular regalia of the seventh to twelfth centuries are reused Roman and Early Byzantine gems rather than new imports. Even the use of diamond chips for engraving or drilling may have become less common. This is suggested by ignorance of the matter in the thirteenth century by the German friar Catholic bishop and ultimately saint Albertus Magnus. He had su icient interest in and knowledge of gems to write about them in his Book of Minerals but admitted I do not understand how they engraved gems are made except that it is by some articial and not natural method. Those however who write about gems say that work on very hard stones is done with fragments of diamond which are sharp and extremely hard. But I myself do not believe this is true at all. For engraving demands instruments properly adapted and this cannot be with fragments of diamond unless they should be softened with goats blood. And this would be wasteful and much too costly for sometimes we see a gem of little worth that has been engraved Albertus Magnus 1967 133. T here had been increasing numbers of European traders traveling to the eastern Mediterranean in the later rst millennium AD. Many were Italians because of the close ties between Italy and Constantinople and the eastern Christian empire. There were Venetian and Genoese trading conclaves in cities in Syria and Palestine by the late eleventh century and by the end of the twelfth century Venice essentially monopolized the maritime trade in the east Mediterranean. Both Venice and Genoa also had signicant trade into the Black Sea thus linking up with the more northerly extension of the Silk Route as traveled by the Venetian Marco Polo at the end of the thirteenth century. Against the background of this expanding trade 62  Medieval Europewe begin to encounter mentions of diamonds in Europe. These include descriptions of their appearance and protective qualities but seemingly no mention of specic diamond set objec ts. Marbode the bishop of Rennes in Brittany in his De Gemmarum written in the eleventh century said that diamonds were best set in silver armored in gold and fastened to the left arm Albertus Magnus 1967 211. But Marbode and the other medieval writers who say much the same thing are repeating sources that are ultimately Indian and cannot be taken as evidence necessarily for a fashion for wearing diamonds in this way in Europe. The Persian poet and polymath Umar ibn Ibrhm al Khayym Nshpr 10481131 better known in the West as Omar Kha yym echoed earlier Islamic writers comments when he said In India bits of diamonds and red ruby are used on rings and ear rings while in Europe Bahrami pure red ruby and Zulmani best green emerald are used Nshbr 2004 145. Diamond in Europe Pre 1200 In Europe there are some supposed instances of diamonds from the eleventh and twelfth centuries but nothing tangible of which I am aware. The Holy Crown of Hungary also known as St. Stevens Crown probably of eleventh or early twelfth century date p reserved in the Hungarian Parliament building in Budapest has been said to include diamonds on its arches Twining 1967 9697. However Patrick Kelleher a military captain who was responsible for the crown after it had been placed with U.S. troops for safekeeping toward the end of World War II made a detailed study of the crown and simply described it as set with gems and pearls Kelleher 1951 33. Certainly the gems visible in the numerous available photographs do not seem to Medieval Europe  63include any diamonds. Diamonds are often said to have embellished the clasp of the so called Mantle of Charlemagne in actuality a pearl encrusted mantle pro bably made for Roger II the Norman king of Sicily in Palermo in 113334 and now in the Imperial Treasury at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna inv. XIII 14. The presence of four octahedral diamonds in this clasp was noted as early as the eighteenth century when it was in the Treasury of St. Denis a monastery near Paris before its loss Goguet 1758 116. But it is not impossible that the clasp was made when the mantle was used for the coronation of Maximilian II as king of Bohemia in Prague in 1562 Johnson 2011 216. The jeweler and diamond historian Herbert Tillander mentions representations of diamonds in twelfth century Ger man drawings but provides no references or illustrations. The Pala dOro altar screen in St. Marks Basilica Venice is sometimes said to include diamonds but I havent spotted any and besides although parts of it date from the early twelfth century many gems have been replaced over succeeding centuries. T he Later Medieval Period Albertus Magnus may not have believed that diamond chips were used to engrave other gems as noted above but one of his colleagues at the University of Paris in the 1230s or 1240s did. T his was the English philosopher and Franciscan friar Roger Bacon who was perhaps the rst to refute the received wisdom that diamonds could only be broken with goats blood. He says that he knew this was untrue because he had seen diamonds being broken with his own eyes adding that gems cannot be carved without fragments of this stone Bacon and Burke 1928 168. His comment is signicant because it shows that diamonds were being broken into chips for lapidary purposes in thirteenth century Europe and thus tha t some diamonds were 64  Medieval Europenow available. Indeed the rst certain evidence for diamonds in later medieval Europe seems to be in Venice at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The Italian historian Piero Pazzi remarks that although an old translation of a Venetian will of 1208 that equates what are described as the giaconicii set in a ring with yellow diamonds may be fanciful diamonds must have been known by about this period because in 1223 there was a prohibition against goldsmiths setting counterfeit diamonds Pazzi 1986 910. Further to the east Edward Gibbon tells us that John III Doukas Vatatzes emperor of Nicaea in what is now Turkish Anatolia from 1222 to 1254 presented the empress with a crown of diamonds and pearls Gibbon 1828 83. This was apparently paid for by the sale of the eggs of his innumerable poultry. Mentions of diamonds become far commoner as the thirteenth century progressed. In the Bibliothque Nationale in Paris there is a bestiary essentially a medieval encyclopedia of natural historydating from around 12501260. The section on diamond has an illustration of a man nding a diamond gure 4.1 with the accompanying text telling us that the diamond comes from the East where it is found at night by its shining. Octahedral diamonds on an eastern mountain were seen in the Franco Flemish manuscript of a bout 1270 in gure 1.3. A more practical text from about the same time perhaps a decade or two later is a dictionary probably for Italian merchants the so called Inte rpreters Book part of the Codex Cumanicus now in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana in Venice Golden 1992 Kuun 1880. This has word lists in Latin Persian and Cuman the Turkic language then being spoken between the Ukraine and central Asia thus tying in with the reestablishment of the Silk Route as a relatively safe commercial artery from the eastern borders of Europe to China following the emergence of the Mongol empire. The precious stones listed include diamond with its Latin name given as diamante an early instance of this modern form Kuun 1880 1089. The Venetian chronicler Martino da Canale tells us that at the celebrations marking the election of Lorenzo Tiepolo as doge in Venice in 1268 the goldsmiths were arrayed in rich clothing decorated with precious stones of great value including diamonds Buckton 1984 6. A quarter of a century later Marco Po lo set o east along the Silk Route and on his return provided a useful glimpse of the diamond trade. The Indian diamonds that reached Europe he tells us were only the refuse any diamond of importance was taken to the Grand KhanKublai Khan in Chinaand other rulers Yule and Cordier 1993 2361. Polos editor Giambattista Ramusio adds that Polo brought back diamonds to Venice sewn into his clothing. These were not obtained in India he says but exchanged for gold in the Khans court because so great an amount in gold would have been impossible to carry on a journey of such extreme length and di iculty Yule and Cordier 1993 15.Although most diamonds reaching Europe were brought to Venice or Genoa merchants then carried them north. They were reaching England by the second half of the thirteenth century if not earlier. We hear of a brooch set with two diamonds belonging to King Henry III of England in 1261 and others set in a gold cup that the rebellious Robert de Ferrers Earl of Derby had to relinquish in 1265 to obtain this same kings pardon Txier 1857 641 British Library MS ADD 15664. Also that year we have a record of the jewels pawned by the king including a remarkable total of thirty eight diamond rin gs kept on two sticks Public Record O ice 1910 502. The treasure of Henrys successor Edward I ruled 1272 to 1307 is said also to have included a diamond set rin g Lehmann Brockhaus 1960 no . 6261. Nevertheless diamonds were not always present in royal jewelry. In 1272 Henry III of England sent a considerable amount of jewelry to Paris for safekeeping. The list includes all manner of jewelry including crowns brooches and rings with diverse precious stones rubies spinels sapphires emeralds topazes and peridots are named but there is no mention of diamonds Rymer 1727 187879. Early fourteenth century ment ions of diamond set jewelr y include two diamond set r ings supplied by the Parisian goldsmith Guillaume le Perrier in 1303 Richard 1887 235. A document dated 1304 says that John II of Avesnes 12471304 Count of Hainaut Holland and Zeeland had a small diamond ring and the inventory of Count Robert de Bethnethe Lion of Flandersmade following his death in 1322 included a beautiful diamond he had received from his father Dehaisnes 1886 401 440. Diamonds could also be possessed now by the rising class of rich merchants and tradesmen. For example at the time of his death in 1317 Richard de Blountesham seemingly a wealthy London taverner owned two diamonds although their value was noted at just six shillings and eight pence Medieval Europe  67there were twenty shillings to a pound and twelve pennies to a shilling Riley 1868 124. Also there was a useful test for a wifes faithfulness if any man put a Diamond under the head of a woman sleeping she manifesteth if she be an adulterer for if she be so she leapeth back out of bed afraid and if not she embraceth her husband with great love Best and Brightman 1973 9394. Such a test would have been cruel to report if suspicious husbands had no access to such stones. Albertus Magnus attributes this same power to the mineral magnetite but Bartholomeus Anglicus an early thirteenth centur y scholar cites diamond in this context as does a manuscript of the mid thirteenth century  Albertus Magnus 1967 22 Evans and Serjeantson 1933 30. Garcia de Orta in the mid sixteenth cen tury commented on this belief but said it was a thing I am unable to believe Markham 1913 349. A century later the English writer Thomas Nicols quotes it without any misgivings Nicols 1652 51. From the second half of the fourteenth century onward diamonds became relatively abundant in Europe. In England there are several mentions of diamond rings such as those given as diplomatic gifts by the kings Edward III and Richard II. For example in 1392 Richard II sent a gold ring set with a diamond to the king of France with Sir Thomas Percy who was with the embassy negotiating peace in Englands Hundred Years War with France Newport 1837 246. Two years later he gave another diamondset gold ring to Viscount de Meloun who was visiting England on a similar peace mission Newport 1837 253. In the time of Richard II an import duty was imposed for every pound weight of precious stones or any manner of jewels brought into England Ruding 1840 23738. Some records give the prices paid for diamonds. In the second half of the fourteenth century we have two diamond rings bought for a total of 12 one for 5 and one diamond for 68  Medieval Europe20 Newport 1837 156 265. A ruby and diamond ring cost Figure 4.2. Gold ring set Edward III the then huge sum of 167 and he paid 65 for a s ingle large diamond Newport 1837 176. Records of diamonds in private hands include one set in a ring involved in a legal dispute in 1367 Thomas 1929 75. Surviving Later Medieval Jewelry Set with Diamonds Despite the relatively abundant documentary mentions there are few tangible examples of diamonds in Europe until the mid fourteenth century .

The cross itself was made in the 1350s by order of Charles IV emperor of the Holy Roman Empire 13161378 known to many as King Wenceslas. The nail reliquary attached to it is probably not much earlier as suggested by its enameled black letter inscription. The cross the nail reliquary and the gems set in it were examined in detail by Czech conservator and photographer Andrej umbera in 2003 umbera 2008. A fresco in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary at Karlstejn Castle Czech Republic shows Charles being presented with what appears to be an octahedral diamondpossibly the one set in the nail reliquary gure 4.5. The identity of the donor of the diamond is uncertain. Possibilities include King Louis I of Hungary reigned 13421382 Peter I king of Cyprus and king of Jerusalem reigned 13581369 or the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos ruled 13411391. If the latter the diamond may have been a diplomatic gift to help secure military aid against the Turks.1 Another important medieval diamond set objec t is the so called Founde rs Jewel in New College University of Oxford gure 4.6. It is in the form of a crowned Lombardic initial M and was made in about 1350 probably in France. Among the rubies emeralds pearls and enamel is a single small uncut diamond set top center. This ornament is also known as the Hylle Jewel because it was a gift to the college in 1455 from the Hylle family of Winchester. In the nal third of the fourteenth century we have surviving diamonds in greater profusion. One of the most spectacular examples is the Crown of Princess Blanche also called the Figure 4.5.

This splendid gem set gold cro wn left England as part of the dowry of Princess Blanche daughter of Englands Henry IV who married Ludwig III in 1402. It was originally owned by Anne of Bohemia who had married Englands King Richard II in 1382 and was probably made in Paris around 137080. Medievalist Jenny Stratford has recently discussed the crown at some length in her book on the treasures of Richard II based on the surviving treasure roll listing compiled in 13989 now in the National Archives E 1014119 Stratford 2013 25862. This extraordinary scroll is more than thirty yards long when unrolled. The crown is perhaps the only surviving piece of the 1200 odd jewels listed in the king s inventory. The crown is set with sapphires spinels emeralds and pearls and nestling in the center of quatrefoil clusters of pearls there are diamonds gure 4.8 or in several cases imitation diamonds. The quatrefoil pearl clusters may be similar to the three rings each of four pearls and a great diamond placed in the middle of each that Richard II purchased from a London goldsmith John Palyn for Anne of Bohemia in 13812 Devon 1837 221. The inventory refers to the crown as being set with thirty three diamonds of which eight were imitation. The genuine diamonds are very small octahedra uncut but of reasonably regular shape. The imitations are pyramids of gold probably integrally made with the settings with applied black enamel the apex of each blackened gold pyramid is of exposed gold perhaps the enamel pulled back from the apex as a result of surface tension while ring. The same inventory also includes a mirror back and an image of the Virgin Mary with clusters of pearls around what are described as imitation diamonds Stratford 2013 288 361. Also listed are collars that incorporate diamonds thus challenging the oft repe ated statement that the earliest diamond necklace recorded was that belonging to King Figure 4.6.

The rings set with diamonds remind us of the diamaundes of derrest pris set in gold rings as mentioned in the 1370s by the English poet William Langland Kane and Donaldson 1988 255.Several European diamond rings dating from around the late fourteenth to early fteenth centuries have survived that have a high bezel set with an octahedral diamond crystal such as that shown in gure 4.9 now in the Victoria and Albert Museum London. Recently two similar rings have been found in England one at Manley Cheshire in 2002 gure 4.10 and another at Fleckney Leicestershire in 2008. Both rings were found by metal detectorists and subsequently passed into the market. T he ring in gure 4.10 is inscribed sans n loiautloyalty without end.

We dont know how big the three large diamonds in Richard IIIs treasure were but probably far smaller than the diamond reportedly the size of a walnut that was listed as part of the dowry of Valentine Visconti daughter of the Duke of Milan when she married Louis Duke of Orlans in 1398. This diamond then known as Balle de Flandres passed to Charles the Bold and then seemingly disappeared when Charles was defeated at the Battle of Grandson in 1476. This may well have been the diamond that eventually resurfaced recut as the Sancy Balfour 2009 244. If so with the Sancy weighing some fty four carats c ut the Balle de Flandres must surely have been some seventy plus carats to start wi th. Not all the diamonds reaching Europe in the later medieval period came via the northerly Silk Route. They could have been obtained by European merchants in Alexandria and other Mediterranean trading centers at the interface between the European and Islamic worlds. The more southerly land routes to the Mediterranean and the coastal sea trade from the Red Sea or Ormus to India were thriving with Arabs playing a signicant role until they were largely displaced by Europeans in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the sixteenth century Garcia de Orta mentioned Arabs in India sending diamonds to Arabia Markham 1913 343. In his Best Thoughts on the Best of Stones the Arab poet and author Ahmad al Tifashi died 1253 says that Baghdad was a major center for the diamond trade and repeats what he was told about diamonds by some Persian gem dealers who often visit India. Tifashi who was born in Algeria also mentioned jewelers from North Africa who were acquainted with diamond Abul Huda 1998 119. Tifashi made much the same comment as Marco Polo that the most brilliant diamonds were worn by Indian dignitaries for adornment purposes they keep it jealously for themselves and the rest were either used for cutting corundum or given to the merchants. As we have seen the commerce between Europe and the Islamic world was growing as the rst millennium came to a close with the Italians playing a major role. It is only after about 1200 however that we begin to nd clear documentary evidence for diamonds in medieval European jewelry with a gradual increase in mentions over the following decades and surviving examples from the later 1300s.

Medieval Europe  77I t is one of historys amusing coincidences that in Europe the negative prex a disappeared from the old term adamas unconquerableat about the same time that diamond became conquerable with the development of polishing and cutting the most fundamental development in the history of diamond. This chapter will consider the dawn of diamond polishing and cutting in Europe where it is likely to have been understood by 1300 AD although evidence is sparse. Subsequent chapters will look at the possibility of early cutting in India and the development of the more advanced diamond working technolog y familiar to us today. 5 T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting in Europe Cutting and Polishing Since the sixteenth century diamond cutting has been seen as consisting of three main stages. In the optional rst stage the diamond is cleaved split or sawn to provide the starting form for abrasive shaping and polishing. The stone is then rubbed against another diamond to laboriously grind it closer to its intended nal form including creating the main facets at faces. This stage is described as bruting. Then in the third stage the diamond is held against a rotating iron wheel or scaife fed with diamond dust and oil to complete production of the facets and give the overall polish. A byproduct of the bruting stage is diamond powder which is used in the nal polishing. Earlier approaches to diamond cutting were less sophisticated. Initially there was the polishing of the faces of crystals See gure 5.7. 79and cleavage fragments. Bruting may have played no part here and the rotating scaife was still unknown. In what follows I use the term cutting in a general sense to cover any or all of the stages in diamond working the term polishing refers specically to the nal polish of a face or facet. An acquaintance with the use of diamond powder for gem polishing must have reached Europe by no later than around 1200 about the same time as diamonds themselves began to appear again. The original ninth century Arabic text of th e Pseudo Aristotle De Lapidibus doesnt mention the use of diamond powder to polish other gems but a fourteenth century Lat in edition of the same text doesthe words it uses are poliuntur et planantur polish and smooth. A section of the so called Aberdeen Bestiary f. 101r a Latin manuscript written about AD 1300 also says that with sharp pieces of diamond other stones are engraved and polished  poliuntur . One manifestation of this renaissance in gem use and cutting was a move to colored gems cut with at faces away from the smooth convex shapes typical of earlier times. An example is the faceted sapphire in the upper center of gure 4.8. We see this change in surviving European jewelry while further east in Cairo fourteenth century dowry documents from the Jewish community begin to regularly include cut precious gems Goitein 2000 4205. Thus it is not surprising that by the fourteenth century in Europe perhaps the late thirteenth the faces of some octahedral diamond crystals were being improved. T he Earliest Cutting Diamond polishing before the fourteenth century has not been substantiated in Europe. The gold cap of Pietro Tradonico doge of Venice between 836 and 864 has been described as set 80  The Dawn of Diamond Cuttingwith a diamond with eight facets Quick and Leiper 1959 53. However natural octahedral diamond crystals have eight faces and besides this jeweled headdress has been described as probably apocryphal Singleton 1905 256. The mid thirteenth century L apidario compiled from Islamic sources for the scientically inclined King Alfonso X of Castile has been said to provide a brief account of diamond cutting and polishing Barrington 1906 34. However although this text mentions diamond splinters for drilling and engraving gems and the produc tion of diamond powder the latter seems only to have been in the context of a painfully intrusive method of removing kidney stones and for use as a poison the former perhaps more likely to kill you than the latter. There seems to be no mention of the cutting or polishing of diamond itself Lapidario 2004. Indeed the various medieval Islamic writers had been consistent in stating that diamond could not be cut starting with the Iraqi Yaqb ibn Ishq al Kind in the ninth century who in his metaphysical musings used diamond as an example of indivisibility Ivry 1974 107. Herbert Tillander remarked that cut diamonds can be seen in German engravings of royal crowns from the beginning of the twelfth century Tillander 1995 66. He doesnt provide supporting references however and he also proposed that polishing of diamond crystal faces began in the thirteenth century which would surely rule out cutting in the twelfth. Tillander also says that the French term naf for natural diamond crystals had been used at least since the middle of the twelfth century thereby implying that non naf that is cut diamo ndswere also known Tillander 1995 22. Although the word naf is recorded as early as the mid twelfth centur y in reference to rocks I have been unable to nd examples of the term in the specic context of diamonds before the early fteenth century. T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  81As the fourteenth century progressed descriptions of cut diamonds began to appear in inventories and some diamond workers were named such as a German diamond cutter named Jehan Boule Jean Boulle who was documented in Paris in 1381 Fagniez 1877 3056. Other fourteenth century c utters are more elusive. According to the German historian Christof Gottlieb von Murr diamond workers were recorded in Nuremberg in the 1370s a statement accepted by jeweler and author Edwin Streeter and a misquoting of which perhaps lay behind Feldhauss statement that there were diamond cutters there in 1237 Murr 1778 695 Streeter 1877 23 Feldhaus 1952. However the gemologist and historian Godehard Lenzen examined the sources and found no denitive evidence for fourteenth century cutting in Nuremberg Lenzen 1970 68. Venice is often cited as the cradle of European diamond cutting but although books and websites frequently mention records of diamond cutters in Venice in the 1330s I have not been able to nd a primary reference for this. Neither did Lenzen 1970 7374. The Italian historian Piero Pazzi in his book on the history of the diamond trade in Venice similarly made no mention of such early cutting there Pazzi 1986. Most recently Salvatore Ciriacono professor in the Department of Historical Sciences at the University of Padua said It has been proven that point cut diamonds are to be found in Venice as early as the thirteenth century but he too cited no reference Ciriacono 2014 69. In 1864 Charles King mentioned Milanese jewelers including the fourteenth century goldsmi th Anguillotto Bracciaforte saying These lapidaries . . . even polished diamonds but gave no further reference or substantiation King 1864 32627. In any case some form of basic diamond cutting was probably practiced in Europe by the early fourteenth century perhaps the late thirteenth and if so an Italian center such as 82  The Dawn of Diamond CuttingVenice with its links with Eastern trade would be a likely place for this to have occurred. As we will see simple faceting of diamonds was certainly being carried out by the 1360s. Once we get into the 1400s there is far more information. An early specic mention of cut diamonds is a document written by a Jewish gem merchant in Venice in 1403 Sirat 1968 that provides separate prices for cut and uncut diamonds. In 1434 the Flemish copyist and bookseller Guillebert Mets provided a description of Paris for Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy from 1419 to 1467. The original manuscript survives in Brussels in the Bibliothque Royale Albert 1er MS. 955964. Mets mentioned the district La Courarie rue de la Couvroierie where workers in diamonds and other stones lived Le Roux de L incy 1855 7273. He also referred to several skilled workmen such as Herman who polished diamonds of various forms Le Roux de Lincy 1855 84 Laborde 1872 251. T he name Herman suggests a Flemish origin Lenzen 1970 73. Mets openly acknowledged that he copied and extracted from the works of other chroniclers so his comments on the Parisian diamond cutters might have been drawn from another source Le Roux de Lincy 1855 3. Medievalist and jewelry historian Ronald Lightbown equated Herman with the known Parisian goldsmith Herman Ruissel a.k.a. Rinssel Rince Ruisseau who had been active in Paris from the mid 1380s L ightbown 1992 16. Several diamond cutters are also recorded in Lyon France from the 1460s onward and at least one in Geneva Audin and Vial 1918 158 Audin and Vial 1919 89 247 Brun 1905 334. The term used in the Geneva document is diamantarius. Further north in Antwerp and Bruges several diamond cutters are known by name including Wouter Pauwels who was described in the cathedral archives there in 1483 as a dyamantslyper Lenzen 1970 73 Kockelbergh et al. 1992 29. Godehart T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  83Lenzen considers this choice of term signicant since dyamantslyper literally meant diamond polisher not diamond cutter and thus referred to just polishing not proper cutting Lenzen 1970 73. However the drawing of a fully developed diamond cutting mill by Jan Luyken in 1694 see gure 6.8 is still titled Diamantslijper. In fourteenth century Europ e colored gems were still being polished as described by Theophilus Presbyter probably a Benedictine monk in Germany in the early twelfth century Hawthorne and Smith 1979 18991. Theophilus makes no mention of diamond but explains how gems such as members of the quartz family beryl and emerald were polished by rubbing f irst on a at smooth lead plate using nely ground abrasive and water or saliva then on leather with ner abrasive. For sapphire emery was used as abrasive and the washings were collected the emery powder was allowed to settle overnight and then dried and reused. The process may have looked like that in an illustration in Hortus Sanitatis rst published in Mainz in 1491 gure 5.1. Indeed this drawing is often reproduced as an illustration of medieval gem polishing. However it appears in the Hortus Sanitatis accompanying the section on cinnabar mercury sulde and may have been intended as an illustration of its grinding for use as a pigment. The fourteenth century writer Jean dOutremeuse of Lige also described how gems were polished on at tables of various materials including lead using powdered emery and other abrasives Cannella 2006 270 and 282. The use of a piece of at marble for polishing gems might be implied in a short and rather obscure poem by the physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova ca. 12401311 Wecker and Read 1660 240 If you would have a Jewel for to shine Seek for a polishd piece of Marble ne 84  The Dawn of Diamond CuttingFigure 5.1. An illustration from the 1499 Strasburg edition of the Hortus Sanitatis Garden of health showing a man grinding a stone or mineral on a at surface. Under the Stone the Jewel must be got With little waterle you hurt it not T he harder tis the more twil shine I wot. In the early seventeenth century William Heth a clerk of his majestys store for the navy at Portsmouth in his Goulden Arte or the Jewell House of Gems advised jewelers that they could get keep and maintain the nest polish on diamonds and other gems by polishing them on a smooth at and even lead table Heth 1603 66r. It seems likely that Heth meant a stationary rather than a rotating table. T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  85Early Cutting Technology T here is no sure evidence for the use of a horizontal rotating polishing table for gems in medieval Europe prior to the fteenth century although a small wheel mounted on a rotating axis had been used for gem engraving in classical times and was also well known further east Boardman 1970 381 g. 316 448. The traditional Indian lapidary wheel consisted of resin mixed with abrasive. The wheel was rotated on a horizontal axis by means of a bow a piece of wood with a length of cord attached end to end and wrapped once around the axle. By moving the bow back and forth the wheel rotated. This type of gem cuttin g lapidary wheel like almost all early rotating craft devices across the ancient world including lathes and regardless of whether they were vertically or horizontally mounted had a reciprocal back and forth motio n. The resulting jerking rotary rhythm would not have been conducive to accurate faceting. Besides precious diamond dust couldnt be proigately embedded in a resin wheel it would have had to be employed in modest amounts on a at metal wheel where weight would have generated rotary momentum incompatible with bow powe red to and fro motion. Indeed early in the fourteenth century the Indian mint master and mathematician Thakkura Pheru had observed that diamonds could not be ground on a lapidary wheel Sarma 1984 52. Herbert Tillander assumed that the earliest stage in diamond cutting was a simple supercial smoothing of the natural octahedral crystals of diamond. For example he says that most of the little diamonds in the Bohemian crown of circa 137080 see gure 4.7 were rubbed with some sort of polishing agent Tillander 1995 24. Tillander says some sort of polishing agent if he is implying anything other than diamondemery say this might have served to clean o  surface accretions but it is optimistic to expect it to have any signicant e ect on the surface of the diamond itself. The earliest improvement to diamond was almost certainly carried out by rubbing it on a lead or other at surface with diamond powder as abrasive as described above a suggestion also made by diamond specialist Paul Grodzinski 1953b 1. The mid fourteenth century tra velogue attributed to a probably ctitious Sir John Mandeville notes that diamonds were so hard that nobody could polish them. However his comment that there were other crystals like diamonds but not so hard and that commonly their points were broken o  and they will lightly polish them might hold an echo of the early polishing of diamonds Letts 1953 116. It was so entrenched in the medieval mind that diamonds could not be cut or polished that stones that had been so treated could surely not be true diamonds. T he octahedral faces on the diamond set in the ring in gure 4.9 of about the same date as the Bohemian gold crown seem to have sparse parallel lines that may indicate some slight attempt at improvement with diamond dust. An octahedral diamond crystal abraded and polished to create a neat regular double pyramid shape is termed a point cut. Unfortunately some writers have confused things by also describing natural octahedra as point cuts. It is not always possible to distinguish point cuts from the most regular and shiny natural octahedra especially from photos. However diamond hardness varies slightly with crystal direction and it is extremely di icult to polish a crystal face on a diamond without doing so at a slight angle which thus results in an octahedral poin t cut with apex angles di erent from those of a natural crystal. A surviving f ifteenth century rin g is perfect witness to the early days of diamond cutting. The little diamond set in it is an octahedron but of the four visible surfaces two retain their original and rather irregular crystal form and the other two faces have been polT he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  87Figure 5.2.

That on the right in the photo shows a change in angle of polish halfway up. Presumably the two natural faces were considered su iciently at but the other two must have been more disgured originally and warranted attention. The quality of polish is very good. T he ring in gure 5.3 is set with a remarkably evenly shaped shiny octahedron and is likely to be an early surviving example of a point cut. The ring dates to the later fourteenth or early f ifteenth century and is probably Italian. Here the inscription in Latin says Jesus passing through the midst of them went his way which comes from Luke 430 and was a protection against dangers but also had political signicance and is seen as a legend on some medieval English gold coins. Another example of such a diamond is in the ring in gure 5.4 which is of the fteenth century. Said to have been found in England this ring is also now in the British Museum O. M. Dalton 1912 no. 720. The hoop to one side of the diamond shows the Virgin and Child the other depicts the English saint Thomas  Becket.

T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  89Descriptions of Cut T he diamonds listed in inventories in the thirteenth century and for most of the fourteenth are described simply as diamonds and we must assume that they were probably octahedra whether polished or not. The usual lack of any qualifying description implies that more extensively cut diamonds were unknown. The occasional descriptions we do have could refer to how they were setthere are more ways to set an octahedral diamond than point up. As an example the 1360 s inventory of Louis I Duke of Anjou included a ne gold goblet set with various gems among which were forty two diamo nds. The inventory says that half of these were pointed the remainder triangular and the latter described as plas en triangle Moranvill 1903 82. Plas and variants such as plat and plaz  meant at so perhaps this simply meant diamonds set so that they had a f lat upper surface. We nd examples of dyamans plaz in the accounts of Philip the Bold Duke of Burgundy in 1369 and a large diamond plat en guise dun escu belonging to King John II of France 135064. Flat diamonds also appear in the inventory of Richard II of England Prost 19024 203 Bapst 1884 29 Stratford 2013 234. The term at diamonds might have referred to polished cleavage fragments or attish crystals but octahedra set on their sides also pre sent a at t riangular appearance. T his type of orientation has been encountered with the naturally glossy diamonds in the earlier Eastern jewelry see gures 3.7 and 3.8 and is well attested in surviving jewelry from later medieval Europe. Some may be triangular cleavage slices but not all are. In theory the reections seen in the stone will reveal whether it is a complete octahedron or a cleaved half. It is also worth remembering that the high refractive index of diamonds makes them appear far thinner than they really are when set in this way and viewed from above. An example of a diamond set 90  The Dawn of Diamond Cuttingon its side is in the fteenth century rin g in gure 5.6 which was discovered by metal detector in northern England in 2001 Treasure 2001 65. We can see a gold ring set with this type of diamond in a painting dating to about 1460 from the workshop of the painter Rogier van der Weyden. Now in the National Gallery London inv. NG1433 the Portrait of a Lady shows the lady wearing the ring on the third nger of her left hand. T here are also diamonds set in this way in several brooches dating from around the 1430s and 1440s found in Flanders now in the British Museum gure 5.7 and the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna gures 5.8 and 5.9. The jewel in Vienna is probably the one listed in a 1544 inventory that describes the diamond simply as triangular  driegekheten  Kovcs 2004 228. As can be seen in gure 5.9 however none of the three visible corners appears to be an octahedral point. This suggests that this stone is a cleaved slice of diamond see gure 1.1 that has had its upper surface and sides polished. Which of the other triangular diamonds of this period are sideways set oc tahedra and which polished cleavage slices remains to be seen. The triangular diamonds shown in the painting of the Federlin a hat badge made around the early 1460s and looted from Charles the Bold Duke of Burgundy between 1467 and 1477 following the Battle of Grandson in 1476 gures 5.10 and 5.11 look as if they are intended as sideways set o ctahedra.

It appears to be some sort of table but the upper diamond may be a version of what Tillander terms a Burgundian pointed cut Tillander 1995 3436. There is a diamond point of many faces  plusiers faces  listed in an inventory of 1482 Finot 1895 169. Herbert Tillander proposed that diamond octahedra set on their sides to pre sent a tr iangular appearance might equate with the diamonds described in some documents as escutcheon that is shield shape Tillander 1995 128. Two early mentions are the escusson diamonds described as set in a reliquary listed in the 1372 will of Jeanne dEvreux 131071 the third wife of King Charles IV of France Gay 1887 549 and two gold rings owned by Charles V of France reigned 136480 Laborde 1851a 81 and 94.

Examples include a fteenth century gold ring with an inscription in Italian now in the British Museum see gure 1.8 Ward et al. 1981 84. The inscription Loreso a Lena Lena makes this perhaps one of the earliest surviving diamond set bet rothal rings. The ring in f igure 1.9 is of similar date with a diamond set in this same way next to a ruby. This pairing of a diamond and ruby is matched by a very similar ring now in the Victoria and Albert Museum which may suggest a special signicance perhaps a connection with betrothal as suggested in Chapter 1 Somers Cocks 1980b 46. An octahedron set on its side in this way might equate with the diamond mis en lozenge lozenge set in a ring that Philip the Bold Duke of Burgundy purchased from the goldsmith Jean du Vivier in August 1368 Prost 19024 1364. Lozenged seems to have become a general term for faceted however and this may be an early use of the term in this sense.Figure 5.8.  left  Detail of an enameled gold brooch with triangu lar diamond D utch or Burgundian ca. 1430 1440.

Other examples are found in the inventories of the Duc de Berry in 1416 and later in the century in the inventories of Charles the Bold and Ren of Anjou Gui rey 1896 290 Laborde 1851b 126 175 Quatrebarbes 1846 145. An alternative at least by the later fteenth century was to describe a diamond as brut such as un petit diamant brut in the 1480s and Figure 5.11. Detail of one of the sideways set diamo nds shown in gure 5.10. Credit HMB Historisches Museum Basel. Photo P. Portner. a quarter of a century later une pointe brute de diamant Finot 1895 169 185. Brut is a French word meaning raw or unref ined the origin of the English brute. We also nd pointed diamonds described as non fait unmade but it is unclear what this meant. It was not synonymous with naf since the 1416 inventory of the Duc de Berry includes some pointed diamonds described as nayf some as non fait and some as both Laborde 1872 252. Neither did it mean unmounted since some non fait diamonds are described as set in gold rings. A large pointed diamond surely intended to represent a point cut is shown set in the Three Brothers jewel one of the jewels looted from Charles the Bold after the Battle of Grandson in 1476 gure 5.12. The pendant so called because of th e three large spinels has a long and well documen ted history.

Portner. 96  The Dawn of Diamond Cutting the Parisian goldsmith Herman Ruissel who we saw earlier was perhaps also a diamond cutter Kovcs 2004 388. This invoice describes the large diamond as quarr also spelled carr or carre . This French term is somewhat problematic. One of the earliest uses would seem to be in the 1360s Bapst 1884 29 but it becomes far commoner in the 1380s. In 1380 Charles V of France had a ne diamond well carr Moranvill 1903 581 no. 3559 Laborde 1851a 83. Diamond historians Hubert Bari and Bernard Morel suggested that there was no evidence for cutting before 1400 and that references as here to carr simply meant a natural octahedron of good square shape Bari and Sautter 2001 179. However this seems unlikely. In August 1388 the Parisian goldsmith Jehan du Vivier charged Philip the Bold 320 francs to esquarrer a large diamond and set it in a ring Prost and Prost 190813 439. The fourteenth century historian J ean dOutremeuse of Lige wrote several works including an ambitious natural history and lapidary in four books. The fourth book recently published by Anne Franoise Cannella p rovides our earliest description of diamond cutting. DOutremeuse explained how an irregularly shaped diamond crystal could be polished Cannella 2006 266. He tells us that if the diamond is horned or humped you can resize the horn or the hump and make a beautiful  quarree  stone and of beautiful fashion polishing it as best you can. But we cannot polish as well as nature polishes Cannella 2006 245. This passage is not precisely dated but must have been written during the second half of the fourteenth century prior to the writers death in 1400. Intriguingly Indian texts also use the term horn in the context of diamond shapes. The Garuda Puranam already centuries old by dOutremeuses day says A diamond with one of its angles or horns broken or mutilated or looking as if scratched withered or trampled down should not be retained in the household though otherwise possessed of all commendable features as it would certainly bring hosts of unexpected evils in its train Dutt 1908 183. Quarr later usually carr is a French word meaning square or squared but with regard to gem cutting in at least some cases it seems to have been used in a more general sense of faceting. In any case the use of the term carr applied to diamonds in the 1360s surely indicates that diamond cutting was being done by then. The medievalist and jewelry historian Ronald Lightbown similarly suggested that the word was used to mean faceted Lightbown 1992 15. Indeed even in the seventeenth century the French traveler and gem merchant T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  97Jean Baptiste Tavernier used the term carr to describe both simple table cut diamonds and a large rose cut diamond he sold to the French king Louis XIV Bapst 1889 403 5. A countersuggestion by Jenny Stratford that carr literally meant of square shape may be true in some cases Stratford 2013 19. Jewelry taken by the Duke of Bourgogne on his trip to Cambrai in 1385 included a one piece set wi th six large spinels two described as cabochon  cabuisson  two as hexagonal   huit costs  and two as quarr Prost and Prost 190813 184. Here square might well have been meant but another spinel owned by Charles V of France in 1380 was described as having eight carrs Laborde 1851a 87 presumably meaning eight facets. Early Table Cuts If the point of a diamond octahedron was damaged it could be smoothed down and polished to form what is termed a table cut. If the top needed to be ground down to any signicant extent bruting may have been used. Table cuts probably originated as early as the fourteenth century and became common in Europe in the fteenth century onward. For example inventories reveal that Charles the Bold owned numerous table diamonds including twenty four in one objec t Laborde 1851b 111. These may often have been square or rectilinear as we think of them now but the term may also have been applied to f lat topped gems of other shapes from triangular to polygonal. For example a table diamond of many faces is listed in a 1439 inventory Laborde 1851b 419. Anna Somers Cocks has pointed out that the Madonna in Jan van Eycks Ghent Altarpiece completed in the early 1430s is wearing a crown with what appears to be a large point cut diamond anked o n one side by a very regular triangular faceted diamond with a a t 98  The Dawn of Diamond Cuttingtable Somers Cocks 1980a 15. Nevertheless the square or rectilinear form became the commonest diamond cut in Renaissance Europe and will be discussed later. Hog Back Cuts Flat polishing allowed the fourteenth century c utter to make use of damaged crystals and variously shaped diamond cleavage fragments. When struck in the right direction with a blade a diamond will split or cleave in a direction parallel with a crystal face see gure 1.1. The cleaving of diamonds was well understood in India at least as far back as the fourteenth century. However it is not until the following century that we start to nd diamonds in European jewelry that appear to be various shape cleavage fragments that have had their faces polished as in Mary of Burgundys ring of the 1470s see gure 1.7. This type of irregular diamond is now usually called a hog back a term coined as recently as 1980 by jewelry historian Anna Somers Cocks as an English equivalent of the old French dos dne donkey back Somers Cocks 1980a 15 Somers Cocks 1980b passim. Early mentions of dos dne include a 1446 description of a sta  of enameled gold set with a diamant  dos dne and a diamond cut en dos dasne with many faces listed in Mary of Brittanys 1469 inventory Morice 1744 14067 Gay 1887 549. A diamond described as fashioned like a kirk riggin a church roof that we nd in an inventory of James V of Scotland dated 1562 might be a local description of this same form Thomson 1815 5960. To be able to polish the invincible diamond certainly challenged a millennium and a half of widely believed myths about the stone. Those writing about diamonds had to try to blend old beliefs with new knowledge. Thus Jean dOutremeuse tells us that goats blood is mixed with the diamonds you want to T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  99tenderize and soften and they will soon become soft enough to be cut on the lead as with other gems Cannella 2006 245. The lead anciently described as being used to break diamond is thus here identied with the at lead table on which gems were typically polished for example Cannella 2006 270 282. In contemplating the birthplace of European diamond cutting it may be relevant that one of the earliest references to diamond cutting is a document in Hebrew dated 1403 copied with some additions fty years later that compares prices on the Venetian market for uncut and cut diamonds with comments on judging quality Sirat 1968. The sellers of diamonds to Philip the Bold Duke of Bourgogne 1342 1404 were frequently of Italian origin Genoese in particular. For example the Genoese merchant Pierre Labourebien supplied Philip with an eleven carat diamond quarr in 1387 Prost and Prost 190813 283. One of the earliest specic mentions of table cut diamonds is in an Ita lian inventory that of Paolo Guinigi Lord of Lucca in Tuscany dating to 143031 Lightbown 1992 37 38. However Guinigi had been in both London and Flanders so he may not have obtained his table cuts in Italy. We can note the early use of the term carat applied above to weight. A carat is four grains and internationally dened as 0.2 grams today although varying from place to place until the early twentieth century. Our word carat derives via a plethora of spellings from the Greek keration. It was used as a gem weight in Europe from at least the early 1300s. What is certain is that the ability to polish diamonds created a new market in Europe for poorer quality diamond octahedra and fragments a development that must have a ected the trade dynamics in India and at trading centers in the eastern Mediterranean. Indians would have had a eld day with this new market for stones previously unsaleable while the European elite and the jewelers working for them would have had access to a 100  The Dawn of Diamond Cuttingfar greater number of diamonds and in an increasing variety of forms. The new ability to make use of cleavage fragments may have brought a greater number of larger diamonds into Europe thus fueling advances in cutting. Before this the pointed diamonds in Europe were almost invariably small. They were generally the refuse from India as Marco Polo had said. In 1758 Antoine Yves Gogue t commented that the diamonds set in a reliquary that Jean Duc de Berry had presented to the Abbey of St. Denis in the late fourteenth century then still surviving in the abbey treasury were very small black and in no way agreeable to the eye Goguet 1758 11617. Two diamonds in the 1360s inventory of Jeans brother Louis I Duke of Anjou described then as very large and very ne weighed just two carats each Moranvill 1903 557. A diamond octahedron weighing two carats would measure around nine millimeters tip to tip. There were some larger stones such as the point cut in the Three Brothers pendant and the so called Balle d e Flandres which was said to be as large as a walnut and is possibly an earlier manifestation of the Sancy Diamond but if the vast majority of diamonds reaching Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were far smaller than a garden pea it is hardly surprising that precision diamond cutting was slow to develop. In summary we can suggest that the use of diamond powder as a lapidary abrasive was known in Europe no later than the 1200s probably about the same time that documents show that diamonds were used in medieval European jewelry. The polishing of diamonds may have followed there soon after but there is no certain evidence for this so far until the later fourteenth century. Until well into the fteenth century diamonds were probably being cut and polished by rubbing on a at surface with diamond powder and the rotary cutting table or scaife was not yet in use. T he Dawn of Diamond Cutting  101I n 1476 Charles the Bold the last Duke of Burgundy lost the Battle at Grandson near the southern tip of Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland and with it he lost his treasure. That same year four hundred miles to the northwest in the city of Bruges in the dukes Flanders domain Lodewyk van Berken is supposed to have invented diamond cutting. These two events are linked by more than date. Berkens f irst major commission is said to have been the cutting of three large diamonds for the duke. This chapter will consider the usually dismissed claim of Berkens invention and explain the signicant technological advance in the fteenth century that made modern cutting possible and ponder whether the two 6 T he Fifteenth Century Techn ical Revolution really might be connected. T he story that Berken invented diamond cutting in 1476 as recorded by Robert de Berquen claiming to be his descendant two centuries later has tested the credulity of many Berquen 1669 the most obvious problem being that diamond cutters and surviving examples of their work are attested from well before 1476. Even the jewelry looted from Charles the Bold at Grandson probably included cut diamonds. However diamond cutting improved noticeably during the fteenth century around the time Berken is said to have lived. T he Crank and Belt Drive Diamonds were being supercially polished and perhaps cut in Europe by the fourteenth if not thirteenth century and as See gure 6.6. 103postulated earlier this was probably carried out by rubbing a diamond on a at surface with diamond dust mixed with oil or water much as shown in gure 5.1. This simple technology coupled with the small size of most of the diamonds reaching Europe limited what could be achieved. More precise diamond polishing required the development of smooth fast continuous rotary motion not the back and forth of a rubbing table or the to and fro of a bo w operated c utting wheel. The secret was the crank and belt drive one of the most dening technological advances of the later medieval period. T he origins of the simple crank the principle of the bicycle pedal lay in antiquity. A primitive form of crank drill was used by Egyptian stone vase makers more than four thousand years ago and there are representations of crank operated knife and sword grinding wh eels from at least as early as the ninth century White 1962 110. The German goldsmith and monk T heophilus in the early twelfth century described several crank operated machines for grinding turning and cutting although crank operated hand mills o nly seem to have seen widespread use in Europe in the fteenth century Hawthorne and Smith 1979 67 13233 160 Gille 1969 1446 47. However the use of the crank alone was not su icient for accurate diamond cutting where high speed precision and minimal vibration were essential. The crank had to be employed in combination with a f lywheel and a belt drive. The earliest use of this combination in Europe seems to have been in Italy where silk spinning technology from China was adopted in the thirteenth century a conclusion reached seemingly independently by Bert Hall 1979 104 and Edgar Samuel 1980. Samuel has suggested that this spinning technology was rst adapted for use in lens grinding for the spectacles then coming into use and then taken up by the early diamond cuttin g industry in the fourteenth century thereby facilitating the birth and development of diamond cut104  The Technical Revolutionting in Italy. This is not impossible but there is little evidence for lens grinding machine ry in Europe before the later fteenth century at the earliest Bedini 1967 Hall 1979 95n39 Uccelli 1944 6670 Burnett 2005 57. Even if there was an ultimate Chinese origin for crank and drive technolog y its application for lapidary work does not appear to have traveled back to the source. The rubies or red spinels and sapphires that are quite abundant in the Ming Period 13681644 Chinese jewels seem never to be faceted and a seventeenth century rep resentation of a Chinese lapidary worker in the Tien Kung Kai Wu shows him using a foot powe red to and fro c ord oper ated mechanism not any form of crank Sung Sun and Sun 1996 306. T he earliest illustrations of crank ywheel and belt drive gem cuttin g wheels date from the fteenth century. One is shown in a manuscript now in the State Library in Munich known as the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars more formally as Codex Latinus Monacensis 197. Here folio 23 verso rather crudely illustrates a gem poli shing mill where a crank works a large wheel that drives a continuous rope that passes over two pulleys to rotate a cutting wheel on a vertical spindle gure 6.1. T he accompanying German inscription says This is a polishing mill like that the grand masters of Venice have on which one polishes all sorts of stones it requires three polishing disks the rst is lead the second is tin the third copper Hall 1979 94 95 173 and fol. 23v. Although a date for this manuscript of around 1430 is often cited Bert Hall has argued on the basis of the watermarks that the section of the manuscript that includes the gem polishing mill is to be da ted to around 147275 Hall 1979 2834. This drawing would seem to be based on the same source as another crank and rope driven gem polishing machine illustrated with far greater precision and sense of scale in a manuscript in the Bibliothque Nationale de France Paris gure 6.2. Here can be seen the same arrangement of a large T he Technical Revolution  105Figure 6.1. A crank and belt drive gem cuttin g machine illustrated in the Codex Latinus Monacensis 197 fteenth century.

The crank handle itself or perhaps treadle is not shown but the square hole into which it would be inserted is. T his drawing is attributed to Henri Arnaut de Zwolle ca. 14001466 who worked for Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy as physician astrologer and organist. The reason a doctor would depict a gem polishing machine is explained in the Latin caption This instrument serves to polish precious stones the collected fragments have secondary medical use. The medicinal use of gems in Europe even in Renaissance times was extensive a list of jewelry and gems taken out of the Tower of London in 1600 includes 258 emroddes emeralds very foul only t for apothecaries Giuseppi 1904 356. A second drawing in the same manuscript shows another gem working machine includin g a crank handle. The way in which this operated is less clear but it includes a sophisticated mechanism for setting cutting angles gure 6.4. These drawings if indeed by Arnaut must date from prior to his death from the plague in Paris in 1466 although Bert Hall again suggests that the section in which these drawings appear may be slightly later Hall 1979 95n39. Hall also pointed out that like the earlier spinning wheel this lapidary equipment was designed for light duty and thus slippage was less of a problem than it would be for most industrial purposes and adds Why it evolved only in the later fteenth century is an unsolved mystery Hall 1979 1056.1 T here is no indication that the sort of machines shown by ArFigure 6.2.  bottom left  Illustration of a gem cuttin g machine probably by Henri Arnaut de Zwolle ca. 14001466.

Arnauts reference to the secondary medicinal uses of the dust generated in gem polishing would also exclude diamond where the diamond dust generated had a far more immediate and important function serving as the cutting abrasive itself. Nevertheless the clamps for holding the gems and the angle sett ing mechanism in the Arnaut drawings do show that at surfacesfacetswere intended not cabochons or more rounded forms. The belt drive mill on which the Grand Masters of Venice polished colored gems was the direct ancestor of the diamond cuttin g mill. Rotate the large ywheel up to the horizontal plane and the resulting equipment is almost identical to the diamond cuttin g mills that became popular in the following century. T he Berken Controversy T he essential and innovative step that would allow the cutting of diamonds on machinery of this type was to make the wheel of iron. At this point a name springs to mind Bruges based Lodewyk van Berken. According to Robert de Berquen 16151672 one of his ancestors in Bruges Lodewyk in 1476 and in a singular spirit of genius invented the cutting of diamonds using diamond powder and an iron wheel Berquen 1669 13. Charles the Bold we are told commissioned him to cut three important diamonds one of which was probably a large diamond lost by Charles at the Battle of Grandson. Lodewyk was later celebrated in popular culture there is a bronze statue of him in Antwerp and he was even the subject of a musical play Berken de diamantslijper by Karel Versnaeyen published in Antwerp in 1868. However his claim to fame has been met with considerable derision by numerous scholars because there is ample evidence of diamond cutting for at least a century before his supposed invention. An early decrier was Jacques Txier in the eighteenth century who dismissed the existence of Lodewyk van Berken and noted that the Bruges archivist Pierre Jacq ues Scourion 17671838 had found no trace of a Berken Txier 1857 640. Indeed Alexandre de Laborde mentions Scourions archive research when he quotes a 1465 case of an amethyst sold as a spinel in Bruges Laborde 1872 251. The experts consulted here were described as diamantslypers namely Jean Bellamy Chretien van de Scilde Gilbert van Hitsberghe and Lonard de Bruckre. Another Berken skeptic was the famous nineteenth century Italian jeweler Augusto Castellani Castellani 1871 85. Once into the twentieth century Berthold Laufer poured scorn on how Berquen soars into this panegyric of his ancestor and most jewelry historians since have said much the same Laufer 1915 49n. Diamond expert Godehard Lenzen summed up the whole Berken story as an unfounded opinion and a convenient myth Lenzen 1970 7273. Most agree that at best Berken may have improved faceting in some minor way. Have we been unfair to Lodewyk van Berken His descendant Robert explained that Lodewyk rubbed two diamonds one against the other and then used the diamond dust that fell T he Technical Revolution  109from this operation in conjunction with an iron wheel to cut the diamonds with a perfect polish Berquen 1669 14. The rst stage here the process by which a diamond is roughly ground to shape by rubbing against another diamond is known as bruting. This may well have been an old process by Berkens time. What is signicant is the focus of Robert de Berquens statement his ancestor polished the diamonds using the mill with some iron wheels he had invented. An iron wheel was a necessity for the precision cutting of diamonds and there is no evidence that such existed before Lodewyk van Berkens lifetime. However there are still challenges to Robert de Berquens account. One is the existence of a small and very precisely faceted pear shaped diamond se t in the so called Burgundian Court Goblet a beautiful rock crystal gold and gem encrusted goblet now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna gure 6.5 Tillander 1995 206. This goblet was described in an inventory of 1467 and so the diamonds must have been cut at least a decade before Lodewyk van Berkens supposed invention. Although basic forms such as point cuts hog backs and tables might be cut on a stationary at table more precisely arranged and numerous facets as with the pear shaped diamond in the Burg undian Court Goblet probably needed a precise rotary wheel. Another problem concerns timing. In 1476 Charles the Bold was at war. In January and February that year he was moving south through France and across the Jura mountains into what is now Switzerland beginning his assault on Grandson on February 21 and culminating in his ill fated battle th ere on March 2. It seems improbable that while preoccupied with these maneuverings crossing the Jura in winter with an army was no simple matter he learned of Berkens invention some three hundred miles away sent him three major diamonds to cut received them back and had one mounted all in time for him to lose it at the battle on the second day of March if we 110  The Technical RevolutionFigure 6.5. Faceted pear shape diamond almost ce rtainly with a at base set in the foot of the so called Burgundian Court Goble t 14531467. Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien KK 27. Credit KHM Museums verband. accept that it was lost at Grandson. Berquen says the duke lost the large diamond a year later at the Battle of Nancy where he also lost his life but as Charles King pointed out by then he had no important diamonds left to lose King 1867 106n.2 T hings may make slightly more sense if we could push Berkens invention back a decade or more to the 1460s or even slightly earlier. This is not impossible. If we assume Robert de Berquens tale has a kernel of truth he can hardly be expected to be exact. Indeed he openly admitted that he would tell the story roughly. Oral traditions in a family are seldom accurate after two centuries. Corroborating evidence for an earlier date might be seen in Robert van Berquens comment that another of Charles the Bolds three diamonds once cut was given by him to King Louis XI. By the 1470s Louis was Charless archenemy. A gift to him of a large diamond would be far more likely durT he Technical Revolution  111ing their negotiations in the 1460s than in their fractious 1470s. T here is a tantalizing postscript here. The Belgian Jesuit scholar Franois Xavier de Feller in his monumental Dictionnaire historique published in 1781 briey mentions Louis Berken a native of Bruges who invented the cutting of diamond around 1450 Feller 1781 403. This is repeated with skepticism a few years later by his fellow countryman P. J. Heylen. Whether this 1450 date was a transcription error or based on some now lost source is unknown. Incidentally Edwin Streeter dated Berkens supposed invention to 1456 here almost certainly a typographic error Streeter 1877 24. Whether Lodewyk van Berken invented diamond cutting with a rotary iron wheel modied a slightly older technique or is a completely ctitious character there seems little doubt that the fteenth century saw a signicant step forward in diamond cutting and that the development of the rotary iron scaife played a major role in this. The earliest specic mention of a diamond cuttin g mill would seem to be from 1496 when Jehan Cayon of Lyon was paid for dressing cleaning and putting on his mill  rabill nectoi et mis sur son molin  a beautiful pointed diamond for Anne Duchess of Brittany from 1488 to 1514 Le Roux de Lincy 1860 4 109. Cayon is described as a dyamentier an early use of the term diamantaire for a cutter of diamonds but not the earliest a 1470s Geneva example was noted above. T he development of diamond cutting also needed a regular supply of reasonably large diamonds. As we have seen most of the diamonds in surviving fourteenth century jewelr y are small. In the early sixteenth century the Italian metallurgist Vannuccio Biringuccio noted According to hearsay the largest diamond that has yet been found in the world is little less than half a walnut Smith and Gnudi 1990 122. This is larger than the hazelnut comparison given by Pliny and smaller than the 112  The Technical Revolutionwalnut sized diamond supposedly lost by Charles the Bold at the Bat tle of Grandson in 1476. T he evidence would seem to suggest that the rst half of the f ifteenth century saw an increase in the number of larger diamonds reaching northern Europe. It is possible that one important player here was the French merchant Jacques Coeur ca. 13951456 a highly signicant gure in the Levant trade whose extensive network and large eet brought to France many Eastern commodities including gems. By the time of Coeurs death the expansion of the Ottoman Turks had conquered Constantinople largely closed down European trade in the eastern Mediterranean and destabilized the overland Silk Route. This curtailment of European trade prompted the search for alternative ways east a search that within a few decades led to the nding of a sea route to Indiathe land of diamonds. T he Diamond Cutting Mill T he introduction of crank and belt driv en iron cutting wheels what are termed scaifesin the fteenth century largely explains the blossoming sophistication of diamond cuts in Renaissance jewelry. An early description of the bruting and polishing of diamond is by Vannuccio Biringuccio around the year 1530 but only published in 1540 a year after he died Smith and Gnudi 1990 122. He says The art of grinding it diamond and of making it lustrous and reducing it to a square oblong or angular form is by long and continued rubbing with another diamond and of working it with its own powder on a wheel of tempered steel then of copper and then of lead depending on the degree of polish that is to be attained. Some thirty years later Biringuccios compatriot the goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini said much the same Ashbee 1967 3132 T he Technical Revolution  113Diamonds you can never cut alone you must always do two at a time on account of their exceeding hardness no other stone can cut them it is a case of diamond cut diamond. T his you do by means of rubbing one against the other until a form is obtained such as your skillful cutter may wish to produce and with the diamond powder that falls from them in the process the nal polish is subsequently given. For this purpose the stones are set in little cups of pewter and held against a wheel by means of certain little pinchers prepared on purpose and they are thus held with their dust mixed with oil. The steel wheel upon which the diamonds are cut and nished should be about the thickness of a nger and the size of an open hand and of the nest steel excellently tempered. T his wheel is fastened to a hand mill and turned round as fast as it is possible to turn it. Four to ve diamonds or even six can be applied to the wheel at the same time and by bringing to bear a su iciently heavy weight you can in creas e the pressure of the diamonds upon the wheel and give greater grip to the dust which wears them away and so they are nished. In Europe the earliest representation I know of a diamond cutting mill contemporary with Cellini and Biringuccio is that in f igure 6.6 an illustration heading the section on adamas in the 1551 Naturalis Historiae opus novum by the Marburg theologian and philologist Adam Lonizer 15281586. Here a jewelers shop is shown with a splendid inventory on display and even a royal customer while in the background an assistant turns a large wheel with a crank to work what appears to be a diamond mill. The drive shafts and gearing seem overly complex and may have been designed for water as well as hand power but the basic sturdy wood framed mill is similar to late r such depictions. As we shall see there was a water powe red diamond mill in Paris in the 1530s. The edition of Lonizers work shown here 114  The Technical RevolutionFigure 6.6. Jewelers shop with a diamond cuttin g mill. From the 1551 Naturalis Historiae opus novum by the Marburg theologian and philologist Adam Lonizer. Credit Mannheim University Library Sch 106345. has later rather garish coloring with even the point cut diamonds set in jewels below the workshop scene so augmented.3 T he simple crank on the curious diamond cuttin g machine that Anselmus de Boodt of Bruge 15501632 one of the fathers of modern mineralogy illustrated at the beginning of the seventeenth century and which he says he invented gure 6.7 would not provide the fast even rotation required for diamond cutting Boodt 1609 39. This machine was intended to cut many diamonds at the same time but was probably never made. It is surprising that de Boodt seems unaware of the drive mechanism and heavy framed diamond cuttin g mill that had become standard by his time. The type of machine shown by Lonizer remained in use into relatively modern times. A 1694 drawing by the Dutch artist Jan Luyken gure 6.8 is a good example. In both Lonizers and Luykens representations we see the large drive wheel to provide high speed and momentum and a weighty wood frame to ensure the stability essential for precise cutting. In essence the mechanism here is the same as the fteenth century lapida ry machines but the drive belt and wheel are rotated to the horizontal so that both cutting and drive wheels have vertical axes. The very large drive wheel allows T he Technical Revolution  115Figure 6.7. Multiple diamond cutt ing machine invented by Anselmus de Boodt of Bruge. After Boodt 1609 39. high speed the solid weighty wood frame ensures the stability essential for precise cutting. T his type of diamond cutt ing mill was also illustrated by Andr Flibien the court historian to Louis XIV of France in his monumental 1676 Des principes de larchitecture Flibien 1676 2365. Flibien accompanied his drawing with a description of the diamond cuttin g process. In addition to explaining how facets were cut on diamonds using a scaife of soft iron and diamond powder he mentions like Cellini how rough diamonds were bruted a process that generated diamond dust Flibien 1676 235960. Gems such as ruby sapphire and oriental topaz yellow sapphire on the other hand he tells us were cut on a hand turned copper wh eel using diamond powder and polished with tripoli powder Flibien 1676 2360. T he Dutch geographer Johan de Laet 15811649 had earlier described the cutting of diamonds in some detail in his 1647 De Gemmis et Lapidibus published in Antwerp Laet 1647 56. 116  The Technical RevolutionFigure 6.8. Diamond cutting. Jan Luyken Diamantslijper 1694. Credit Collection Amsterdam Museum RP P OB 44 536.T he cutting he says was carried out on an iron wheel fed with diamond dust mixed with oil. He rejects the idea of putting excess weight on the stone. De Laet provides no depiction of the diamond mill or explanation of how it was powered but we can assume that it was the sturdy classic type of diamond cuttin g mill. Alternative Power Sources Turning a crank evenly and as fast as possible as Cellini instructs was not easy. The merchant politician and writer Gerard Malynes who ran diamond mills in the sixteenth century noted that even a small diamond might take three or four days on the mill taking much time and labor to polish them Malynes 1622 75. When an Isaac Silver was indicted for theft in London in 1759 it was said that he works at turning a wheel for a diamond cutter  which is hard work Old Bailey Proceedings Accounts of Criminal Trials 30 May 1759. So alternative power sources were tried. In the 1530s Matteo del Nassaro known in France as Mathieu dAlnazar was paid to construct a water powe red mill to polish diamonds emeralds agates and other types of gems in Paris Laborde 1880 370 La Tour 1893 910. Del Nassaro was a goldsmith and gem cutter originally from Verona who worked for some time in France at the court of King Francis I. A water powe red diamond cuttin g wheel is also said to have been used by Philip Holbein grandson of celebrated artist Hans Holbein who was described as a diamond cutter and royal jeweler from Lisbon in the later sixteenth century Thieme Becker 1907  s.v. H olbein Philipp I Stetten 1779 144. A water powe red diamond cutt ing wheel would not be out of place in sixteenth cent ury Europe where the combination of cranks and waterwheels had already revolutionized industry as so copiously illustrated by the father of 118  The Technical Revolutionmineralogy Georgius Agricola in his De Re Metallica Agricola 1955 passim. The complex gearing for the diamond mill in gure 6.6 would appear to be suitable for water power. Agricola also illustrated various machinery operated by horsepower and the silversmith sculptor and gem cutter Hans Lobsinger is credited with the invention of a horse powe red diamond mill in the rst half of the sixteenth century in Nuremburg Feldhaus 1952. According to Lobsinger his machine could drive three mills and he named Paulus Koch as one of the several diamond cutters in that city who were using his invention. He notes this machine and numerous other inventions of his in a petition to the magistrates of Nuremberg when he had nancial problems in 1550. This is nearly three centuries before horse powe red diamond cutting is supposed to have been introduced into Amsterdam Elliott 1832 23. Later steam power came into use and a small steam engine was used in the recutting of the Koh i Nur in Lond on in 1852. T he Iron Scaife De Laets and Flibiens mention of an iron scaife a slightly later version of which is shown in gure 6.9 is signicant. Both Cellini and Biringuccio in sixteenth century Italy sp ecically said the scaifes were made of steel. At about the time Flibien was writing the French gem merchant and traveler Jean Baptiste Tavernier scorned the poor quality of diamond cutting in India compared with that in northern Europe Ball 1889 245. One reason for this he says was that the Indians used steel scaifes rather than what he described as the better perfor ming cast iron ones employed in Europe. He explains that cast iron was better than steel because it could be easily led smooth. He also noted that the Indians over weighted th eir wheels. It thus seems that Indians in the seventeenth century were using diamond cuttin g T he Technical Revolution  119Figure 6.9. Iron scaife on a diamond cuttin g mill probably eighteenth century.

Robert de Berquen had specically attributed the invention of the iron scaife to his ancestor Lodewyk van Berken in Bruges in 1476 as we saw earlier. This is tantalizing. If Berken existed did he invent the steel scaife but his descendant assumed it was iron because that was normal by his day Or did the steel scaife pre date Berken who imp roved on the cutting process by replacing it with one of iron If sixteenth century c utters in northern Europe were using iron scaifes but those in Italy as described by Biringuccio and Cellini still used the inferior steel ones it might be one reason why the northern cutting centers became preeminent. Angle Gauge and Dop T he crank and belt drive were not the only innovations that were crucial in the development of sophisticated diamond cutting. The diamond had to be held rmly against a cutting wheel in a way that allowed precise adjustment of angle and position. Even with the earlier rubbing of gems on a xed table the ngers alone would seldom have served and as Theophilus described in the twelfth century the stone was attached to the end of what is now called a dop stick using pitch. Experienced cutters can produce remarkably accurate cuts with just a simple dop stick or dop stick in conjunction with a notched wooden board but precision is facilitated by using a stone holder xed onto an adjustable support. Two gem holders were shown by Henri Arnaut de Zwolle in his drawing now in the Bibliothque nationale de France one on each side of the wheel see f igure 6.2. These held the gems in xed positions against the wheel. The quadrant measuring device also shown by Arnaut see gure 6.4the medieval equivalent of the lapidary angle gaugehas thirty two div isions to the right angle a number that would allow a variety of facet angles to be cut accurately. T his quadrant pre dates by almost a cen tury and a half the one illustrated by de Boodt in 1604 and which Grodzinski considered to be the earliest Grodzinski 1953b 45. Today a lead tin alloy sold er is used to hold the diamond on the dop and this too has a long history. De Laet referred to this lead tin solder in his d escription of diamond cutting and a century earlier Cellini talked of pewter being usedthat is a lead tin alloy Lae t 1647 5. A generation after Cellini in 1597 the English poet Michael Drayton equated the budding beauty of Jane Shore Edward IVs mistress with an uncut diamond in lead Ere it be set in some high prized r ing Drayton 1753 1329. This could be a reference to the rough diamond set in lead on a dop awaiting cutting or an early mention of the practice of casting a rough diamond in lead so that its cutting could be planned. Before the adoption of these new cutting techniques diaT he Technical Revolution  121mond shapes as described in inventories are still usually relatively simple. For example in an inventory from around 1430 we nd diamonds described as pointed at naf square pointed f lat with three sides with three lozenges and escutcheon see for example Finot 1895 16163. We often nd the at face polished on a diamond described using the French term face and variants such as fasse. Examples include several diamonds described as a fasse owned by Charles the Bold Laborde 1851b 45 11 and 116. As the end of the fteenth century approached we begin to nd more descriptions of diamonds with many faces for example Finot 1895 169 197. The rst use of the word face for a facet on a diamond that I have found in Britain is from 1578 in an inventory of the jewelry received by Mary Queen of Scots from James Hamilton Duke of Chtellerault Thomson 1815 26567. Bruting Robert de Berquen refers to his ancestor Lodewyk van Berken rubbing two diamonds together to grind them to approximate shape prior to cutting and polishing them on the wheel. T his was the process we call bruting. De Laet similarly explained how two diamonds were rubbed against each other until the sides and corners were made even the dust being collected below them in a bronze boxas illustrated by Flibien and the eighteenth century En cyclopdie of Diderot and dAlembert gure 6.10. Both Biringuccio and Cellini indicate that the bruting stage was a laborious one. The former talks about long and continued rubbing with another diamond and the latter refers to rubbing one against the other until a form is obtained such as your skillful cutter may wish to produce. More recently George Harlow curator of gems and minerals at the American Museum of Natural History has described the 122  The Technical RevolutionFigure 6.10. Bruting diamonds. Credit From the eighteenth century En cyclopdie of Diderot and d Alembert. great force needed to grind the two diamonds together and notes that when bruting was done by hand craftsmen often su ered long  term damage to the ir hands and wrists Harlow 1998 232. The term bruting comes from brute diamond a rough or uncut diamond from the French diamant brut which as we have seen was a term in use by the late fteenth century in France and not long after in England for example Malynes 1622 75. Diamond Powder T he descriptions of diamond cutting from Biringuccio and Cellini onward make it clear that the diamond powder produced in the bruting process was used to cut the diamonds. However not all the diamond powder used by a diamond cutter let alone other lapidaries could be generated from diamonds being bruted and cut. Agricola in the mid sixteenth centur y specically explained that diamond powder was brought from India by the Lusitanians Portuguese Agricola 1955 114. He also noted in the context of other lapidary work that it costs the T he Technical Revolution  123engraver of gems little to use emery a considerable sum to use diamond Agricola 1955 115. That diamond powder was an item of commerce from India in the fteenth century raises questions as to how old this trade was and whether any diamond powder used in European lapidary work was produced in Europe prior to the Renaissance. Diamond powder was best produced by crushing what is termed boart diamond of too poor a quality for gem use. An early use of the term spelled bord  occurs in an account of the costs of cutting two diamonds for Queen Elizabeth I dated 1596 Salisbury 1915 58889. In 1665 Robert Boyle noted that one London diamond cutter makes much of his powder to polish diamonds with only by beating board boart diamonds as they call them in a steel or iron mortar and that he has by this way made with ease some hundred carrats of diamond dust Boyle 1738 145. In 1607 William Hawkins went on the third East India Company voyage to negotiate trade with the Mughal emperor Jahangir. He recounts how a diamond cutter was summoned to the emperors court to cut a diamond of about sixty carats Foster 1921b 112. The cutter requested a small foule diamant that he might grind to make powder but despite being brought a huge chest full of diamonds he was unable to nd one of poor enough quality. This probably reects the quality of Jahangirs diamonds as much as a dearth of poor diamonds in India. Diamond Sawing In addition to bruting and cutting diamonds there was a further process developed during the Renaissancediamond sawing. This process was perfectly explained in a mid nineteenth century accoun t The diamond is cemented to a small block of wood which is xed rmly to a table and a line is made with a sharp a small piece of cleaved diamond where the division is 124  The Technical Revolutionintended to take place which is afterwards lled with diamond powder and olive oil the sawing is th en commenced and if the stone is large the labor of eight or ten months is sometimes required to complete the operation. The saw is made of f ine brass or iron wire attach ed to the two ends of a piece of cane or whalebone the teeth being formed by the particles of diamond powde r which become imbedded in the wire as soon as it is applied to the line Anon 1848 pt. 3 85. I am not aware of any rm evidence for sawing diamonds before the early seventeenth century when we have documentation from 1613 showing the presence of several diamond sawers in Antwerp Kockelbergh et al. 1992 93. It may have been a relatively new process then because in 1647 Johan de Laet described sawing as a recent innovation de Laet 1647 6. He described sawing as elegant cleaving a diamond was faster but more prone to damage the stone although he adds experts rarely made a mistake. Cleavingde Laet uses the Latin term f indendus is the splitting of a diamond when rmly struck in the right direction with an iron or steel edge. Several seventeenth century wri ters mention diamond sawing and although laborious it must have been widespread. Such writers include Andr Flibien and a few years later in England Nehemiah Grew who reported Our European Jewelers when they split one diamond they take a very small iron Wyre and having daubed it with Oil and Powder of Diamond draw it upon the Diamond by a tool to and fro like a saw Flibien 1676 235960 Grew 1681 282. A mention of diamond sawing also occurs in a brief and rather bizarre manuscript in the British Library titled A proposeall for Buyeing of r ue Diamonds Egerton Mss. 3352 fol. 207. This suggested that diamonds for the king could be cut at court to keep costs down as was being done in France. T he manuscript notes that the king is to pay for cutting and slitting and saweing. The English king referred to is not named but is presumably Charles II since the text mentions the French kings minister Colbertthis is Jean Baptiste Colbert whom Louis XIV appointed as Contrleur Gnral des Finances in 1665 and who died in 1683. Louis XIV of course was the great client of Jean Baptiste Ta vernier. T he extremely laborious sawing of a diamond with diamond dust oil and a wire was rendered obsolete by the introduction of the mechanical sawing of diamonds at the beginning of the early twentieth century. This revolutionized the diamond cuttin g industry in particular making it easier for a single octahedral crystal to be cut in two to allow the production of two brilliants rather than just one. More recently still laser cutting has provided even greater speed and precision. T he second half of the fteenth century had been a momentous one for the European lapidary industry diamond cutting included. The rotary scaife was introduced using a crank and f lywheel a combination that permitted precise and miniscule faceting. Whether or not Lodewyk van Berken was the rst to employ such technology in diamond cutting the craft entered a new age bringing sparkle to Renaissance jewelry and a gradual standardization of cutting styles. So e ective was the technology that it remained essentially unchanged into modern times. The introduction of diamond sawing widened the scope for diamond cutters to create ne cut stones from the rough a t their disposal. The development of cutting must also have had a signicant impact on the economics and dynamics of the diamond trade by adding a new stage at which value could be added and margins made. In 1575 the Franciscan priest and cosmographer Andr Thevet told of a Venetian merchant in Alexandria who bought a rough diamond from an Indian for a low price. After cutting and polishing  polir et nettoyer  it he had a diamond of marvelous beauty that he sold for twelve thousand ducats Thevet 1575 411b. 126  The Technical RevolutionT he development and wider adoption of diamond cutting slowly displaced the old myths about lead and goats blood but didnt entirely oust them for some time. In the rst decade of the seventeenth century William Heth hedged his bets by saying that diamond is of marvalous hardnes in so much as it can nyther be cutt without the powder of it selfe or brooke without the blud of a goate Heth 1603 62v. T he Technical Revolution  127T he sixteenth century marked a new era of lavish jewelry and copious use of gems in Europe fueled by the new direct sea trades with Asia and the Americas and in the case of Britain the huge liberation of gems and religious treasures following the dissolution of the monasteries. The diamonds set in Renaissance jewelry take a bewildering variety of forms. These were categorized by Herbert Tillander 1995 but a modern classication of historical objects does not always reect how they were considered originally. With diamond cuts classication of the myriad forms can bring with it an implication of more intent at diversity in 7 Renaissance Table and Point Cuts the past than is warranted. The Renaissance diamond cutters were experimenting and using their newfound skills to convert a wide variety of crystal shapes cleavage fragments and older cut stones into polished gems to delight their patrons while best minimizing weight loss. Inevitably there were a plethora of shapes some more satisfactory than others until some standardization manifested itself. We can see this in inventories and other documents where authors initially described the shapes as they saw them with a uniform nomenclature only gradually appearing. Descriptions of Diamonds We encounter simple matter of fact desc riptions of diamonds in a list of King James V of Scotlands jewelry that was in the Pendant with a large point cut diamond from the Jewel Book of the Duchess Anna of Bavaria 15521555. Credit Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Mnchen Cod.icon. 429 fol. 42r. 129Jewel House in Edinburgh in 1542 Thomson 1815 5960. T here were table diamonds a table diamond fashioned like a heart and one fashioned like a kirk riggin Scottish for a church roof and so presumably the stone was something like a hog back as discussed in Chapter 5 like the diamonds in Mary of Burgundys ring see gure 1.7 or in an IHS pendant of about 15801600 in the Victoria and Albert Museum London a detail of which is shown in gure 7.1. A pendant with a design of this type is shown in the 1552 Jewel Book of the Duchess Anna of Bavaria now in the Bavarian State Library fol. 22. King James Vs jewels also included a diamond described as thick and raised high but without a point one that was three cornered  t hre nuikit nooked like the English nook meaning a corner long on one side a large diamond small at one end and great at the other and another with one small taill and large at the shoulder. One table  tablit  diamond was cuttet under presumably meaning faceted at the back. A more cursory approach to descriptions is seen in a 1600 appraisal of old jewelry from the Tower of London. Here apart from a diamond described as pointed and some sparks see below these jewels were categorized simply as fair lesser mean or counterfeit Giuseppi 1904 356. A list of jewelry dated 26 June 1527 that had belonged to Thomas Cromwell chief minister to King Henry VIII included among the rings another a table diamond another a triangular diamond another a rocky rough diamond Brewer 1872. A list of jewels sent to Henry in 1514 includes the usual pointed and table diamonds but one table was described as rising with Lozenges. There was also a harte heart of dyamant rising full of Lozengesthe description heart then was applied to what we call a pear shape Strype 1594 78. T his is presumably the same as the lozenged diamond like a heart in a list of the kings jewels in 1532 a collection that also 130  Renaissance Table and Point CutsFigure 7.1. Detail of an IHS pendant set with hog back diamonds ca. 15801600. Cr edit Victoria and Albert Museum London M.248 1923. Photo Jack Ogden. contains a lozenged diamond like a shield 2 great table diamonds square loze nged and one long lozenged diamond Gairdner 1880 736. A list of jewels pawned by King Maximilian I in Nuremberg in 1491 had included two bracelets each set with a beautiful table diamond that had been lozenged  lozengiet  Hackenbroch 1979 395. These examples show that the term lozenged was a synonym for faceted and indeed a century later Thomas Corneille explained that diamonds were cut in facets or lozenges   lozange  to cover their imperfections Corneille 1694 1318. The term triangled used in September 1532 to describe a diamond might also have meant faceted Gairdner 1880 555. In England a range of diamond forms was cited by the merchant and government adviser Gerard Malynes who had run cutting mills in the 1580s and was thus well acquainted with the subject Some are faire Triangles others Flower de Luces eur de lis  Roses Harts Columes Demy Crosses or other fashions of Poly Angles and proportions serving for the members or parts of the bodies of things to bee made into many workes and Iewels as the Iewellers will apply the same cut with many Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  131Fassets or Squares Malynes 1622 7475. Here the other fashions of Poly Angles may have included hog backs and the equation of Fassets facets with Squares supports the view that the French carr was also a synonym for facet. In the mid sixteenth cen tury the Italian goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini made the elegantly concise statement that diamonds were cut in three lovely shapestable faceted and point  tavola a facette e in punte  Ashbee 1967 31. Of course all three of these cuts have facets but Cellini presumably uses facettei to mean having more elaborate facets than just the faces of simple point or table cuts. The term facet as used by Cellini is f irst found a century earlier by the mid fteenth century  and from that same period we even have the term facetter applied to a diamond cutter. The term becomes more common in the sixteenth century for example a diamond with facets from 1538 appears in the accounts of Francis I of France Laborde 1872 129 Laborde 1880 247 Rey 1992 1772. I am not aware of the use of the term facet however spelled in English before the early seventeenth century when it was used by Malynes as noted above. Mary Queen of Scots son James I of England purchased a diamond cut in fassets and set in a collet in 1626 Devon 1836 351. Two of the cuts mentioned by Cellini the point and the table became the main Renaissance forms and are discussed here. The more elaborate multifaceted cuts will be covered in the next chapter. T he Point Cut Point cuts the simplest of cut modications to an octahedral diamond crystal were known in the early 1400s and continued to be produced into the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 132  Renaissance Table and Point CutsWe can probably assume that by the sixteenth century most of these as well as the table cuts were being cut on rotating diamond mills rather than the older at tables. A good representation of a point cut is seen in another of the jewels illustrated in the 1552 Jewel Book of the Duchess Anna of Bavaria now in the Bavarian State Library. As can be seen in gure 7.2 the reections in the pointed diamond at the top are perfectly depicted but could easily be mistaken for further facets. Herbert TillanFigure 7.2. Detail of a pendant from the Jewel Book of the Duchess Anna of Bavaria 15521555 showing a large point cut diamond. Cr edit Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Mnchen Cod.icon. 429 fol. 42r. Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  133der explained how the reections seen in an octahedral or modif ied octahedral diamond depend on its proportions however his drawings of these reections vary slightly from the reection patterns produced when using computerized ray tracing software and this might be explained by his use of glass models in his experiments that have a di erent refractive index to diamond Tillander 1995 23 25 27. T he large diamond that Cellini described set in a cope clasp for Pope Clement VII around 1530 was also a point cut assuming that the drawing of it attributed to Francesco Bartoli around 1700 is accurate gure 7.3. This diamond was Cellini tells us supposedly the second largest in the world. The drawing is claimed to have been made actual size making the diamond some 1.5 centimeters square thus around fty to sixty carats. It cost the Pope 38000 Roman scudi the equivalent of about 120 kilos of gold then. We can probably assume that the majority of traditional square pyramid shaped diamonds of sig nicant size from the later fourteenth century onward were point cuts rather than natural octahedra but this was not true in every case. Georgius Agricola explained When a diamond has a natural six pointed form and this is the most highly prized it is set in a ring in such a fashion that a sharp point pro jects from the se tting Agricola 1955 118. Surviving older uncut diamond crystals might well have been reused. An inventory of 1531 includes eight diamond set buttons in four of these the diamonds are described as points cut in faces  tailles en face  while two are described simply as points Hackenbroch 1979 400. This might represent a distinction between point cuts and natural octahedral points. The diamond ring worn by Elihu Yale East India Company governor in Madras as seen in his portraits by James Worsdale around 1718 if brought by him from India may have been a ne natural octahedron Scarisbrick and Zucker 2014 134  Renaissance Table and Point Cuts86 87. A century later when Thomas Motte an o icial with the East India Company left India the Rajah presented him with a rough diamond set in a ring Motte 1800 83. In the fteenth century we also nd a range of point cut diamonds se t on their sides to create a rosette or mosaic like patte rn. Herbert Tillander discussed this style of setting in some detail Tillander 1995 8889. A simple square version Figure 7.3. A pectoral of gold made for Pope Clement VII by Benvenuto Cellini ca. 1530.

Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  135is what Tillander calls a four petalled ros ette which he says was in use by 1411 Tillander 1995 88. An example of such an arrangement with four point cut diamonds can be seen in the fteenth century enameled gold r ing shown in gure 7.4. T his is probably from England. Here the exposed edges have been attened to form narrow tables. A drawing of this four petal ros ette is shown in gure 7.5 along with that of a ve petal version based on Tillanders reproduction of the diamonds in the bridal crown of Princess Margaret of 1468 Tillander 1995 90 g. 149. A pair of clasps with ve petal ros ettes are worn by Saint Catherine in a painting of the Virgin and Child by Gerard David of about 1510 in the National Gallery London NG1432 and the type probably equates with the ower of diamond of ve pieces included in an inventory of Charles the Bold Duke of Burgundy dating to the late 1460s Laborde 1851b 116. There are also more complex versions with six or more diamonds like a German pendant of around 1500 with a hexagonal arrangement of twelve diamonds that is now in the Green vault Dresden Campbell 2009 18. Point cuts largely fell out of favor by the close of the sixteenth century and in the 1650s Thomas Nicols the Cambridge author of a comprehensive book on gems noted that although point cut diamonds we re sometimes still produced they were considered less valuable than table cuts Nicols 1652 5253. Table Cut T he characteristics of the table cut include a at upper surface the tabletypically square or rectangular bounded by at sloping side facets. The lower portion of a table cut the pavilion could come to a point or to a at surface typically smaller than the upper table called the culet from the French for bottom. An old English term for culet was trap and in the 1680s Randle 136  Renaissance Table and Point CutsFigure 7.4.  left  Gold ring set with four point cuts arranged sideways in a square fteenth century. Credit Courtesy of Benjamin Zucker. Holme a herald under King Charles II explained The Traps are the square cuts at the bottom of the Stone from whence the contrary lusters and sparks do proceed Holme 1688 21. The table cut was also often called a thick stone in French epaisse to distinguish it from thin French foible  diamonds that had the same upper part as a table cut but a at back. Many Indian cut stones we re of this latter form and can be seen in abundance in Mughal Indian jewelry. T he simplest table cut was as we have seen an octahedron or point cut with its top point replaced by a at horizontal facet. Cellini referred to a large diamond that had been cut to a point but since it did not yield the purity of luster which one expects in such a diamond its owners had cropped the point and in truth it was not exactly t for either point or table cutting Symonds 1889 39394. John Addington Symonds the translator notes that the word he rendered as cropped was ischericato which was properly applied to an unfrocked or deFigure 7.5.  above  Diagram of the arrangement of the four diamonds in the ring in gure 7.4 and a rosette of ve table cut diamonds. Dra wing Jack Ogden. Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  137graded ecclesiastic. Indeed Giuseppe Baretti provides justication for this in his 1787 Dizionario delle lingue italiana ed inglese noting the use of pianta schericato meaning a lopped plant. It is possible that the word still had the undercurrent of degradation which would t with Cellinis view of the stone. It sounds as if the gem started as a point cut but then had a bit polished o the top perhaps to remove a aw. This destroyed its pointedness but did not su iciently atten it to make a true table. It ended up neither one thing nor the other. Tillander dates the earliest known use of the expression table in the context of a diamond shape to 1431 Tillander 1995 100. He doesnt provide a reference but the following decade Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy from 1419 to 1467 paid a Parisian merchant for a collar set with diamonds some tables some  escuons  and a Brussels merchant for a ring with a table diamond Dehaisnes 1881 B1992. The table cut became ubiquitous in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries largely ousting the point cut. A 1511 portrait of Pope Julius II by Raphael shows what appears to be a large table cut diamond w orn on the third nger of his right hand and if so it is an early representation of the cut gure 7.6. A 1530 inventory includes both une table de dyamant and une table de diamant carre while from 1532 there is a mention of a beautiful table diamond quasi quarre Finot 1885 37. As we have seen the old French term carre or carr literally square was usually used as a general term for facetted but here possibly shape was meant. The use of the term was by no means straightforward. In 1669 Tavernier sold a large group of diamonds to Louis XIV of France. Those he described as carre include what we would term a table diamond of square shape a similar one of rectangular shape and one that is clearly a large at bottomed mult ifaceted pear shape Bapst 1889 4035. Table cuts were one of Cellinis three styles of diamond cuts 138  Renaissance Table and Point CutsFigure 7.6. Detail of a portrait of Pope Julius II by Raphael 1511.

The southern European hat badge in gure 7.7 of about 152575 is set with a range of diamond shapes but mostly fairly regular thin table cuts. About the time this was made the Spanish artist and goldsmith Juan de Arfe y Villafae described the table cut as the perfect diamond de Arfe 1572 4142. At the start of the seventeenth century de Boodt described various diamond cuts of which the most noble was the table and in the 1650s Nicols explained that diamonds were most commonly cut into what he termed a tablet with one plain upper table and four latterall tables two of which are wont to be longer than the others Boodt 1609 69 Nicols 1652 5253. T he table cut was the most common cut for the smaller diamonds that added sparkle to a wide range of seventeenth cent ury Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  139Figure 7.7.

The large hoard of jewelry found during building work in Cheapside London in 1912 known as the Cheapside Hoard was concealed sometime around 1640 Forsyth 2013. This treasure provides many examples of small table diamonds gure 7.8 and one particularly ne larger one gure 7.9. Another particularly ne table cut diamond se t in a seventeenth century rin g is shown from above in gure 7.10.

These three di erent versions of a table cut plus a drawing of that in gure 7.10 are shown in gure 7.11. The shallowness of the de Arfe cut would have meant almost a 60 percent reduction in weight if cut from a regular octahedron. Even Je riess proportions in the mid  eighteenth century would lead to a reduction in weight of about 50 percent if the maximum weight of the stone was cut from a regularly shaped octahedron. This underlines the fact that the form of the rough stone or of an Indian cut stone to be rew orked would signicantly a ect the shape of the nal cut stone. We can see a wide variation in the heights of table cut diamonds se t in the same object.

The reality of course was that table cuts were by no means always of perfect rectilinear or square outline. This is reected in contemporary descriptions such as the beautiful and very large table diamond clear more long than wide and a little narrower by one of the bezel corners described in a 1536 inventory Finot 1885 63. Maximum weight could be retained if the girdle edges of the stone were left rough and this irregularity could be disguised by careful setting. The uneven edges of gold settings in sixteenth and seventeenth century jewelr y are not due to shortcomings on behalf of the goldsmith they were an artice to keep the faces of the gold settings and the sloping sides of the irregularly shaped diamonds in line and regular as in gure 7.10. A 1541 inventory describes a large square table diamond as having one corner covered with more gold than another and two others where one or more of the corners were not in perfection Finot 1885 107. This characteristic of many 142  Renaissance Table and Point CutsRenaissance diamonds and their settings was understood and skillfully replicated in some nineteenth century cop ies. Despite Jeriess mid  eighteenth century men tion of the perfect table the style had been losing favor since the later seventeenth century and many table cuts were being recut as the more fashionable brilliants and thinner tables as roses. T he table cuts reign was over. In 1823 the British mineralogist John Mawe said The table diamond is the least beautiful except the lasques irregular Indian cuts and some fty years later the London jeweler Harry Emanuel noted that the table cut was occasionally seen on diamonds dismounted from old ornaments and stones coming from India Mawe 1823 81 Emanuel 1867 75. Tillander described and drew the large diamond in the Cheapside Hoard in gure 7.9 as what he called a scissor cut but my examination of this object indicated that it is a basic table cut Tillander 1995 122 g. 217. Tillander said the scissor cut dates back to at least 1550 on the basis of a large number set in the heraldic crowned eagle of Anne of Austria dating from about then although he refers to these as scissor cut Hogbacks some of them at bottomed Tilland er 1995 122. The diamond in the ring in gure 7.12 might be an example.

The back of the diamond is cut like that of a traditional table cut tapering to a rectangular culet clearly visible through the stone. This ring with its modication of the table form to increase sparkle represents the changing fashions of the time and is witness to the sort of experimentation that eventually led to the brilliant cut. Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  143Sparks Sparks is an old term for small diamonds frequently encountered in descriptions of jewelry from the mid sixteenth un til the later eighteenth centuries. Indeed a spark is dened as a small diamond in many eighteenth century dic tionaries. Early uses of the term include a ower of golde garnished with sparcks of diamonds presented to Queen Elizabeth I in the late 1570s although another gift around the same time was a dolphyn of mother of perle garnished with small sparks of rubyes and ophall which shows that the term could also be applied to other gems Way 1862 14558 Nichols 1823 70. Eighteenth century usage of th e term seems to have been widespread. As far as the earlier mentions of sparks are concerned they might best be equated with the small table cut diamonds that o ccur in large numbers in sixteenth and seventeenth century jewelr y. By the later seventeenth century however the term probably came to include little rose cuts. A small ring in the Victoria and Albert Museum London and probably of seventeenth century date is of gold set with a small rose cut diamond inv. 90 8 1871. T he inside of the hoop is engraved This spark will grow no doubt alluding to the hoped for love of the recipient for the giver. It also seems that in some cases sparks referred to small uncut diamonds natural sparks or to pieces removed from a larger diamond in cutting Anson 1745 48 Keyssler 1760 23. Setting of Table and Point Cut Diamonds To obtain the best sparkle from a table or point cut diamond the gem had to be set with a shiny foil behind it or more usually over a black substance typically some type of carbon black mixed with resin. Where diamonds are now missing in jewelry this black bedding substance is often visible frequently retaining 144  Renaissance Table and Point Cutsthe imprint of the back of the stone. Examples of this include the necklace from the Cheapside Hoard shown in gure 7.8. There is an ambiguous comment in a seventh century Indian text translated as saying that foul lampblack does not so much as touch the diamond mirror naturally brilliant with a radiance of ever glittering splendor so sorrow touches not the illustrious but it might be optimistic to see this as having relevance here Cowell and Thomas 1897 184. An early European mention of a black backing is in the mid sixteenth centur y by Biringuccio who said If the skin of its diamonds earthiness is cleaned with art and then it is given its polish it becomes very brilliant when a lustrous black color is placed underneath Smith and Gnudi 1990 122. For this purpose Cellini recommended a mixture of soot from a lamp using oil that was old sweet and clear with mastic resin Ashbee 1967 3540. He observed It Figure 7.12.

Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  145is an extraordinary thing that the diamond which is the most limpid and brilliant of all earthly stones gains a thousand fold in beauty wh en you as it were soil it with a black tint. He also added that if blue indigo was used instead of soot behind yellowish diamonds they looked green and most gracious to the eye. Using blue pigment to improve the color of a diamond is a subterfuge still sometimes encountered and which had a particular urry of popularity following the development of waterproof blue aniline dyes in the mid nineteenth cen tury. T he Goulden Arte or the Jewel House of Gemes written in the rst decade of the seventeenth century described the use of candle soot and mastic as a backing for diamonds Heth 1603. According to Thomas Nicols a few decades later The tincture foyl or colour for a true Diamond was pure mastick and a small quantitie of ivory burnt black and nely powdred Nicols 1652 4647 see also Houghton 1727 72. A manuscript in the British Library with the heading Trades Secrets  Receipts Mechanical dating from around the same time as Nicols similarly noted the use of mastic and burnt ivory but adds that the addition of a little spike oil obtained from lavender would increase its strength BL Ms. Add. 78339 fol. 258. From at least the early seventeenth century the term tent was applied to this black bedding material as witnessed by its use in The Goulden Arte where it is explained that a diamond mustnt be too thick or too thin or wont take its tent Heth 1603 65r. An early denition is from Thomas Blounts 1661 Glossographia where tent is the substance they put under Table Diamonds when they set them in work and is made of Mastick and Turpentine Blount 1661 s.v. tent. Turpentine or clear gum was also described as a less advisable alternative to mastic Fryer 1698 214 Hooke and Derham 1726 215. Interestingly de Boodt commented that a real diamond adhered more strongly to the black mastic backing than fakes a useful test for a true stone Boodt 1609 57. 146  Renaissance Table and Point CutsAs an alternative to the black resin or gum mixture it was said that black Velvet is good under a thin Table Diamond scrap ed as you do Lint Fryer 1698 214. The same author also suggested scraped blackened ivory under a thin table and Cellini provided yet another alternative blackened glass Fr yer 1698 214 Ashbee 1967 40. A 1644 comment that His Excellency Diamond like the da rker he is set shines the brighter is a nice allusion to this practice of setting diamonds over a black backing  Mercurius Britanicus Communicating the A airs of Great Britain 29 July 1644. A little later is William Seckers Human misery is to Divine Mercy as a black foil is to a sparkling diamond Secker 1707 2.1 T he history of what we would term the foiling of diamondsthat is setting them over a thin polished metal foil is hard to disentangle since as we have just seen the term foil was applied sometimes also to the black tent Nicols 1652 4647 Fryer 1698 214. It is unclear which meaning Cellini uses when he tells us that in sixteenth century Italy  foiling was forbidden for all gems except diamonds Ashbee 1967 25. I am not aware of any sixteenth or seventeenth century European jewelry with diamonds set over a metal foil although it is common for other gems. In the later seventeenth century the genealogist and writer Randle Holme 16271700 noted the names of the various components of a gold jewelry setting. T hese included the foil he described as a certain colored Tin foil set under the Stone in the Collet to give it a color answerable to it self Holme 1688 21. However this presumably applied to colored gems only. T hings were di erent in India where in Mughal jewelry thin diamonds were often set over thin and typically high puri ty gold foil. However the most reective metallic foils for diamonds are of silver or perhaps in many cases tin and these can be seen in some later Mughal Indian jewelry. I havent seen Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  147a description of how Indian jewelers produced such perfect foils but in the late eighteenth century the English traveler and writer William Eton recorded the Valuable Secret of the foils used behind diamonds and other precious stones as employed by the Armenian jewelers in Istanbul Eton 1798 22526. Thin tin the thickness of strong brown paper scraped very bright was placed over a depression cut in lead of the size of the eventual setting and the foil pressed into this using a mallet and a polished agate punch. It was then cut to shape and highly polished. The result was a beautiful foil scarcely to be imagined by those who have never seen it. Even though of cheap tin such foils were noted as being expensive. By the mid sixt eenth century in Europe some diamonds were also being set with an open back  joure in French. An example is a diamond described as   joure cut as a triangle without foil in a 1556 inventory of the jewelry received by the Queen of Scotland from James Hamilton Duke of Chtellerault Thomson 1815 11718. From 1542 we have diamonds belonging to James Hamiltons second cousin King James V of Scotland described as set on day light a literal translation of  joure Thomson 1815 60. The 1594 will of Lady Anne Dacre includes the bequest of one diamond pointed without a foil East Sussex Record O iceDAN1126fols. 122r127r. T his may also have meant open backed. In general ho wever diamonds set open backed wer e only common after the later seventeenth century. This setting style was particularly suited to the brilliant cut stones then comin g into vogue. In the later seventeenth century Randle Holme dened the other parts of a setting relevant to diamonds  The Collet is the Socket in which the Stone is set.  The Scallops or Muscles of the Collet are the works on the side of it like those shells. 148  Renaissance Table and Point Cuts The Graining of the Collet are little heads of Gold or enammel set a t the Foot of the Scallops.  The Bessel is the top of the Collet which being beaten to the Stone holds it in.  The Cressants are the half rounds which the Bessel is cut into. T he ter ms collet and bezel are still used in the same way today the other terms applied to the typical parts of a Renaissance ring. The type of setting described by Holme was already out of date by the time he wrote about them but it is a reminder that Renaissance gem setting is one of the high points of jewelry history. T he opening up of the European sea trade with Asia and the newly discovered Americas heralded a glittering age of gems with diamonds from India playing a major role. Diamond cutters with improving skills and expanding clientele experimented with diverse shapes but the simple table and point cuts provided a unit y of form sparkled e ectively and made optimum use of the raw material. More facets however could make a diamond even more spectacular and the rose diamond appearedsoon to become ubiquitous. Renaissance Table and Point Cuts  149T he second half of the fteenth century had ushered in a new era of diamond cutting. Improved diamond cuttin g technology increased trade with the East and the ascendance of wealthy European courts had combined to create a heady period of experimentation and rivalry. Diamond cutters were the new alchemists converting diamond rough into glittering jewels. Sparkle required an angular geometry a series of at facesfacetsto reect and refract light. The point cut and the table cut considered in the previous chapter were in the vanguard of this new fashion but there was a limit to their sparkle. To really reect and refract 8 Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts light and to show o  the re of a diamond a greater number of facets were needed. T he Rose Cut T he nal shape of a diamond and the number of its facets were inuenced by the size and shape of the raw material and considerations of weight retention coupled with the aesthetic desire for symmetry. When the starting point was a cleavage fragment of diamond the at cleavage surface could form a at base to the stone and was sometimes left unpolished particularly with the smaller stones. The upper part could be formed into a faceted dome. This form of stone is what we can loosely dene as a rose cut. This echoes the English lexicographer Nathan Baileys succinct denition in the early eighteenth century when See gure 8.7. 151he explained that a rose diamond is one that is quite at underneath but whose upper part is cut in divers little faces usually triangles the uppermost of which terminates in a point Bailey et al. 1730 s.v. diamond. Final form also reected the practical limitations imposed by the accuracy and sophistication of the mechanism necessary to position and hold the diamond against the cutting wheel and the experience of the cutter. There might be anything between six and many dozens of facets on a rose typically all triangular and Herbert Tillander has illustrated numerous varieties of these noting that they were so common during the fteenth and sixteenth centuries that it is impossible to reproduce here more than a selection of the most typical designs Tillander 1995 49. There are also rose diamonds with trapezoidal facets including some of what Tillander classies as at bottomed p ointed star cuts and V cut ros es and some with square facets Tillander 1995 38. If at the risk of what Herbert Tillander considered oversimplication we dene a rose cut as did Bailey one of the earliest could be the precisely faceted diamond set in the Burgundian Court Goblet now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna assuming its base is at see gure 6.5 gure 8.1.

It was we are told elongated rounded above at below rising in the middle to a pointby the sound of it another early rose cut. A pear shaped rose might be mean t by the term fer de lance or spear head which we encounter in sixteenth century F rench inventories.

Based on contemporary representations of this piece in portraits its appearance has been reconstructed by the French jeweler and historian Germain Bapst in 1889 and the gem specialists Hubert Bari and Violaine Sautter in 2001 Bapst 1889 98 Bari and Sautter 2001 253. Although these reconstructions show the stones faceted and rising to points they di er in how they depict the number and arrangement of facets. This underlines the di iculties in identifying cuts from old descriptions or even illustrations. A prime example of the problems of judging diamond shapes by old descriptions dates from around 1530 when the celebrated Italian goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini set a diamond the facets of which were cut starwise to a point in a cope clasp for Pope Clement VII. To modern ears this certainly sounds like rose cut and has sometimes been interpreted as such. However the drawing of the clasp attributed to Francesco Bartoli around 1700 and now in the British Museum clearly shows it as a point cut gure 7.3. The surviving side view shows that the clasp did have enough depth to accommodate a full octahedral point cut. Cellini says he set the stone free held by four claws. That this didnt mean open backed or  jour as some have suggested is demonstrated by the back Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  153view also preserved in the British Museum. Being a rose cut or open backed or both would not have agreed with Cellinis comment that other jewelers thought it would have been better if he had tinted the whole base of the stone and the back facets Ashbee 1967 2930. A further problem with descriptions of roses and their early chronology is the di iculty of deciding whether the descriptive rose applies to the cut of a diamond or a rosette like arran gement of several diamonds. The same is true in French where the equivalent of the English rose diamond is rosette  diamant. So sadly it is di icult to nd unambiguous descriptions of rose cut diamonds in the s ixteenth century. It is tempting to see mention of a rose cut in a French inventory of 1536 that included three settings of gold of which two contained triangular table diamonds and the third a rosette de diamant Gay 1887 209. Less certain are the twelve roses of diamonds and twelve ruby ballases spinels set in gold enameled in white blue and black that were among royal jewels in Edinburgh Castle in 1579 Thomson 1815 293. Gerard Malyness list of diamond forms at the end of the 1500s included Roses Harts Columes Demy Crosses or other fashions of Poly Angles Malynes 1622 7475. This must surely mean that rose was an identiable class of cut. Certainly the section on gems in The Goulden Arte or The Jewell House of Gemes compiled by William Heth at the start of the seventeenth century talks about rose diamonds that are undoubtedly rose cut stones and in ter ms that suggest that such stones were then familiar Heth 1603. In the nineteenth century the London jeweler and author Edwin Streeter noted that it was not until the year 1520 that the Rose cut was int roduced while the form of the Brilliant was not known until the reign of Louis XIII of France Streeter 1877 32. Streeter seems to have derived this infor154  Renaissance Multifaceted Cutsmation from the German born Amer ican mineralogist Louis Feuchtwanger who some forty years earlier said in remarkably similar phrasing that in 1520 they made use of the Rhomb cut and the form of brilliants was invented in the reign of Louis XII Feuchtwanger 1838 51. Streeter presumably took Feuchtwangers rhomb to mean rose and corrected Louis XII later fteenth century to a more sensible Louis XIII early seventeenth for the introduction of the brilliant. It is not clear what Feuchtwanger meant by rhomb cut since it is not an expression he uses elsewhere but he distinguished it from both table and brilliant cuts so multifaceted cutting and thus the rose is likely. Rhomb need not be taken too literally. Terms for facet shapes have not always followed a high level of geometrical exactitude. In the mid eighteenth centur y the diamond expert David Je ries described the triangular facets on a rose cut as lozenges another word for rhomb and a term for facet that had been used as early as the fourteenth century. An early description of a rose cut diamond spec ically named as such can be found in 1611 when King James I of England purchased a fair rose diamond set in a ring from the London goldsmith John Harris Devon 1836 147. The earliest known mention of rose diamonds in Antwerp is dated to 1615 Antwerp 1993 45. William Prynnes 1645 diatribe against papacy quotes two documents of 1623 that list gifts of jewels and which distinguish between pointed diamonds table diamonds rose diamonds and faucet facet diamonds Prynne 1645 5254. Facet diamonds and rose diamonds are similarly distinguished in the 1691 inventory of the French crown jewels Bapst 1889 390. However seventeenth century ter minology could be ambiguous. Randle Holme a herald on whom King Charles II bestowed the remarkable sounding title  sewer of the chamber of the extraordinary equated a faceted stone with a rose when he said The Fosset facet stone or Rose stone is Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  155cut into many squares ending in the Center Holme 1688 21. Here he uses square like the French carr to mean faceted without specic shape implications. Seventeenth century d esigns for jewelry are a major source of information about diamond cuts but again not all is straightforward. In some cases rose diamonds seem to be depicted such as in the drawing of an earring that belonged to King Philip III of Spains daughter Anne of Austria 16011666 gure 8.2. This drawing is one of several designs in a sketchbook of the jeweler Paul Marchal illustrated by Germain Bapst Bapst 1889 33133. Marchal worked for several of the French royal jewelers. In this drawing the diamonds are shown as fairly symmetrical twenty four facet ro se cuts. However Figure 8.2. Drawing of an earring belonging to Anne of Austria 16011666. From the sketchbook of Paul Marchal after Bapst 1889. 156  Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts the rose diamonds in some other seventeenth century jew elry designs are seemingly artistic impressions rather than accurate facet diagrams. An example shown in gure 8.3 is a design by the French jeweler Gilles Lgar 16101685 who came from a family of French goldsmiths and was a court jeweler under King Louis XIV Evans 1917. A book of his inuential designs was published in Paris in 1663 Lgar 1663. The square facet formation in the diamonds shown here is in a pattern of a type that Herbert Tillander conjectured was deliberately based on a Pythagorean mathematical progression Tillander 1995 42. In practice I believe that the pattern shown is impossible to cut as a series of at faces on a convex surface. Lgar seemingly shows the backs of some of the stones as faceted thus implying open backed set tings unless here his cross hatching is just shading. T he Twenty Four Facet Rose T he seventeenth century saw the rise to prominence of the twenty four facet rose that is generally accepted as the epitome of ne antique rose cut d iamonds gure 8.4. When David Je ries published the rst edition of his book on diamonds in 1750 he greatly extolled the virtues of rose diamonds explaining and illustrating the shape and proportions of the idealized twenty four facet form. This form of rose diamond had appeared by the end of the sixteenth century and Herbert Tillander cites the Fellowship Pendant in the Grnes Gewlbe in Dresden probably of the late sixteenth century as the earliest jewel he was aware of that was set with these full twenty four facet rose diamonds Tillander 1995 54. The rose diamonds in jewelry in the Cheapside Hoard deposited around 1640 are mostly small and fairly irregular gure 8.5 but there are a few well shaped twen ty four facet roses. The pendant ornament in f igure 8.6 probably of a generation or so later is noteworthy because it is set with colored diamonds. Here the seven large stones are full twenty four facet roses and fairly reg ular. The numerous smaller diamonds in the same object are far more irregular in shape and symmetry a quality of small diamond often seen in later seventeenth and eighteenth century jewelr y.

This reduced labor retained weight and perhaps fortuitously provided a roughness that aided retention in the settings. The same applies to some of the larger roses. The magnicent order of the Great George in gure 8.7 was made for Charles II in 1661. This with its collar not shown here forming the Garter Collar and Great George was described as set with 20 large diamonds and a one hundred and odd lesser diamonds. The larger stones here are roses. The Order of the Garter was the highest order of chivalry. In 1668 the same king invested his namesake King Charles XI of Sweden with an even grander Order of the Garter. When Charles Howard rst Earl of Carlisle took delivery of this from the Jewel House at the Tower of London prior to delivering it the receipt he signed meticulously noted all the diamonds in ita total of 321 roses fty two of which were described as large Ashmole 1672 appendix. In the Great George pendant in gure 8.7 the settings for the diamonds are in gold but soon silver settings came into vogue the sparkle of the roses and other multifaceted cuts being best set o  by white metal. It might be assumed that a rose diamond with a at polished base would look dark and unsightly when mounted in the traditional Renaissance way over a black bedding material. However experiments reveal that well cut roses can indeed lo ok their best when placed over a black backing. T he increasing popularity of rose cuts is mirrored by their more frequent mention in diamond cutti ng apprentice contracts in Antwerp in the second half of the seventeenth century de Bie 2014 284. In her recent study of the Antwerp rose Annelies de Bie a historian at the University of Antwerp compares the statutes of the 1582 Antwerp Guild Ordinances where the masterpiece required from an apprentice consisted of a thick table a thin table and a faceted stone with a 1672 ordinance by which the diamond cuttin g apprentices still had to cut a thick and thin table but the third stone was now described as an  la mode rose de Bie 2014 284. This is equated with the full twenty four facet rose Ko ckelbergh Walgrave and Vleeschdrager 1992 58. Since the apprentices only learned to cut an Figure 8.7. Great George made for Charles II 1661. It is set with rose diamonds and a few smaller table cuts. Credit Royal Collection RCIN 441924. Royal Collection Trust Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2016. Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  159Antwerp rose toward the end of their apprenticeship the rose cut was clearly viewed as more demanding than a table cut de Bie 2014 285. Other Rose Cuts Not all seventeenth and eighteenth century roses had t wenty four facets. Th e ring in gures 8.8 and 8.9 dating from around 1610 is in black enameled gold set with a high and beautifully polished rose diamond but here with just twelve facets Tillander called this form a Crowned or Twelve facet rose  Tillander 1995 53 Scarisbrick 2007 31213. As this ne ring shows quality of cutting did not then necessarily correlate to facet numbers but such a distinction has been made. By the mid eightee nth century Antwerp had become associated with a poorer class of rose cut diamonds. A ros e cut diamond could be categorized as either an Antwerp or Brabant rose or a Dutch or Holland rose. The distinction according to most published denitions is that the Dutch rose was of twenty four facets th e Antwerp fewersix eight or twelvealthough according to the German mineralogist Max Bauer the distinguishing feature was that the Antwerp roses were shallower the number of facets could be the same Bauer 1968 178 . Other denitions dating back to the 1870s say that if a rose has twelve or fewer facets it is called an Antwerp Rose if it has eighteen or twenty it is called a Demi Holland and if twenty four a  Holland Rose Castellani 1871 88. In the 1867 second edition of his book Diamonds the London jeweler Harry Emanuel says The rose diamond is frequently cut with many less facets particularly those called Antwerp roses but these are much less brilliant and are only used for the commoner kind of work Emanuel 1867 7677. In his rst edition in 1865 Emanuel had made no mention 160  Renaissance Multifaceted Cutsof Antwerp roses and thus provides no indication that cheaper cutting was associated with the town Emanuel 1865. Nevertheless in 1735 John Barrow an English historian and mathematician published diamond prices in his Dictionarium Polygraphicum separated into separate tables one for Dutch cut and one for Antwerp cut. Weight for weight the Antwerp ones were signicantly cheaper Barrow 1735 n.p.. For example a two carat D utch cut sto ne was priced at between 42 and 45 an Antwerp cut one bet ween just 24 and 26. T hese price tables were headed Diamonds cut facet or table wise the former presumably including rose cuts. Barrows assertion that rose cuts were always one third cheap er than table diamonds because the latter looked bigger for their weight when set is strange since the contrary is true. Jaquelado Cut Another early term that may have included rose cuts is jaquelado a Spanish word meaning checkerboard. A 1525 invenFigure 8.8.  above left  Gold ring set with twelve facet rose diamo nd ca. 1610. Credit Courtesy of Benjamin Zucker. Figure 8.9.  above right  Detail of the rose diamond in gure 8.8.

Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  161tory of Catherine of Austria wife of King John III of Portugal includes a jewel set with a spinel a diamond jaquelado and three baroque pearls Cremades 2010 33058. When the Holy Roman Emperor Charles Vs Genoese admiral Andrea Doria 14661560 went to Genoa following the death of his cousin Giannettino Doria in 1547 he gave the widow a jaquelado diamond in the shape of a heart pear shape Porreo and Sueyro 1666 247. Philip II of Spain reigned 15561598 had several diamonds described as jaquelado and a large topaz in the same style  jaquelado a modo de diamante  Cantn 1959 231 and passim. Topaz here was almost certainly a yellow sapphire known as oriental topaz into recent times. There are several examples of colored gems cut this way in the Cheapside Hoard of circa 1640 including some remarkably precisely faceted sapphires. I have tentatively proposed a Portuguese origin for this checkerboard lapidary style and such an origin would perhaps explain the widespread use of a Spanish term for it Ogden 2013 362. Of course not all jaquelado stones were necessarily at bottomed but nor have been all the diamonds described as roses. T here is an interesting statement in a nineteenth century Span ish German dict ionary that jaquelado was a term applied to diamonds cut in the East Indies Tolhausen 1889 163. The original authority behind this statement is unknown but it would make sense if applied to the multifaceted style of diamond cutting encountered with some larger Indian cut d iamonds sometimes referred to as Mughal cut. The origins of this so called Mughal c ut will be considered in the chapter on cutting in India but the form is just a multifaceted or rose cutting style as applied to larger stones. A famous example is the so called Great Mughal Diamond which was in the Mughal Emperor Aurenzebs treasury and supposedly shown to the 162  Renaissance Multifaceted CutsFigure 8.10. An Indian cut diamond bri olette from Nol Antoine Pluche s 1748 Le Spectacle de la Nature. 3D image Jack Ogden. French gem merchant and traveler Jean Baptiste Ta vernier in 1665. Tavernier described this as a round rose very high at one side like half an egg as shown in his drawing although this appears oversimplied and might well have been drawn from memory if he saw it at all Ball 1889 131517 297 Malecka 2016. The best known sur viving diamond of this form is the Orlov Diamond now set in the Imperial Scepter preserved at the Diamond Fund of the Moscow Kremlin Balfour 2009 20914. The use of the term rose for the multifaceted Mughal cut continued into recent times. The Koh i Nur when i t rst arrived in England and prior to recutting was often described in the newspapers as a rose cut. Briolette One version of a multifaceted cut is the briolette which Harry Emanuel described as like two roses base to base and a very beautiful form particularly for pendeloques but these stones are rarely met with Emanuel 1867 77. Two Indian cut pendeloques were sold by Tavernier to King Louis XIV of France. In his Le Spectacle de la Nature in the mid 1700s Nol Antoine Pluche a French priest renowned for this multivolume work on natural history illustrated a pear shap ed diamond cut in Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  163the Indian style taille  lIndienne based on that shown by Tavernier a form he described as an Indian pear or pendaloque Pluche 1748 34952. His drawing is shown in gure 8.10. Demise of the Rose Cut T he introduction of the brilliant cut during the seventeenth century which will be looked at in the next chapter ousted the table cut and eventually the rose cut. In 1813 the British mineralogist and former sea captain John Mawe explained that of late many rose cut stones from Holland ha ve been recut into brilliants notwithstanding the additional expense and the loss of size necessarily attendant on this operation Mawe 1813 60. T his practice had been denou nced by London jeweler David Je ries. For him Rose Diamonds when truly manufactured are not inferior to Brilliants all circumstances considered. We might detect his anxiety about explaining things to his own clients in his complaint that if roses fell in favor due to any perceived superior excellency of brilliants it would be to the great prejudice of the most noble and ancient families who are greatly possessed of them roses as being a more ancient jewel than Brilliants. But Je ries was ght ing a losing battle. Even a generation before his book the 14 March 1724 issue of the northern English newspaper Newcastle Courant commented The Price of Diamond is very considerably changd here of late. Brilliants having been raised to above Forty per Cent more than they sold for before. At the same Time Rose Diamonds are Twenty per Cent cheaper than they were Six Months ago which is occasioned by the large Demands for the former. T here was a slight recurrence in the popularity of roses in the nineteenth century and Harry Emanuel said that although rose diamonds had been unfashionable for a long time they were now back in vogue because they gave a good show for 164  Renaissance Multifaceted Cutsthe money Emanuel 1867 77. One reason for the demise of rose diamonds was that they did not suit the open backed settings that became increasingly popular in the eighteenth century and were ubiquitous by the nineteenth. There was also the simple fact that brilliants looked better than roses. An anonymous writer in the Devizes and Wiltshire Gazette on 24 January 1828 commented that the rose cut diamond w ants the beauty possessed by the brilliant and has not the same play of color an observation made by others as the century progressed. That great master of diamond cutting Marcel Tolkowski famous for the development of the modern brilliant cut said much the same a century later This is the fundamental reason of the unpopularity of the rose there is no re quoted in Tillander 1995 212. T he multifaceted rose diamond brought true sparkle to diamonds and in the 1600s was the most prevalent cut in European jewelry. However it was usurped by the brilliant cut a form with far greater re which rst appeared in about the 1660s. Unlike the rose the brilliant has a faceted lower part and so in its wake came open back sett ings and the dawn of a new age of jewelry styles. Today three hundred and fty years after its introduction the brilliant cut is still the most popular of forms. Renaissance Multifaceted Cuts  165I n 1652 the English naturalist Thomas Nicols described diamond as a gem which doth sparkle forth its glorie much like the twinckling of a glorious star Nicols 1652 46. This use of the word sparkle sums up the change that had revolutionized the diamond trade over the preceding century. Diamonds were now meant to sparkle and this meant cutting a facet arrangement to maximize this. In Nicolss day the rose cut was the epitome of the sparkling diamond but it was soon to be superseded by the brilliant cut still the most popular diamond cut today. T he brilliant cut is characterized by a at upper table typically octagonal bordered by small facets reaching down to the widest 9 T he Early Brilliant Cut partthe girdle. This upper part is called the crown. Below the girdle the facets taper down to either a point or a small at facet called a culet. This lower part is termed the pavilion. The brilliant form developed from the table cut by the addition of extra facets just as the table cut could be produced by truncating a point cut gure 9.1. As Antoine Franois de Fourcroy explained in 1796 Those diamonds brilliants which are cut into facets all over their circumference that is top and bottom have a much superior luster to those which are cut only on one side. On this account lapidaries give the rst the name of brilliant while they call the others roses Fourcroy 1796 2182. A typical modern round brilliant cut diamond will hav e fty seven or fty eight facetsthe ta ble thirty two cro wn facets twenty four pavilio n facets and sometimes a small culet. This is the same number and distribution that David Je ries illustrated in 1751 gure 9.2. The Regent Diamond gure 9.3 is a See gure 9.7. 167Figure 9.1.

Drawing Jack Ogden. 168  The Early Brilliant Cut f ine early brilliant the cutting of which will be discussed in the next chapter. Early Brilliant Cuts T he brilliant cut appeared soon after the mid 1600s but its origins are still debated. The word brillant was used in French to describe a faceted diamond at least as early as 1671 and was so recorded by the French lexicographer Pierre Richelet in his Dictionnaire Franois in 1680 Rey 1992 1291 Richelet 1680 95. Various people in various places have been credited with the invention of the brilliant cut. The inspiration may even have come from a diamond cut by a European in India that had reached the French court in 1669 as we will see in the chapter on diamond cutting in India. France in the time of Louis XIV is a likely center for the introduction of the brilliant cut. Its rise in popularity has often been attributed to Cardinal Jules Mazarin 16021661 rst minister to the French king and an avid collector of diamonds. The so called Mazarin diamo nds which the cardinal bequeathed to the king are listed in the 1691 inventory of the French crown jewels. Here the majority are described as table cut including the famed Grand Mazarin but two the seventeenth and eighteenth Mazarin stones are described as brilliants. However it is not impossible that these Mazarin brilliants had been recut by 1691as the historian Germain Bapst Figure 9.2.  left  A page from David Je riess A treatise on diamonds and pearls 2nd edition 1751 showing the cutting of a brilliant diamond and drawings of cushion round oval and pear shaped brilliant diamo nds from front and back.

It is perhaps not impossible that Mazarin himself was unacquainted with the brilliant cut. What is today the famous Hope Diamond on display in the National Gem and Mineral collection at the National Museum T he Early Brilliant Cut  169of Natural History in Washington D.C. was described by Jean Baptiste Tavernier as cut in the Indian fashion in the form of a heart when he sold it to Louis XIV in 1669 Bapst 1889 374n2 403. Four years later it was recut by royal diamond cutter Jean Pitan also sometimes spelled Pittan and Pitau into a heart shaped brilliant th e French Blue Ogden 2017. Although recut later into the form familiar to us as the Hope Pitans original form is preserved in a lead cast made of it Farges et al. 2009. A replica in cubic zirconium using measurements taken from the lead cast cut by the specialist lapidary Scott Sucher is shown in gure 9.4. There is also the pink Cond or Grand Cond diamond now in the Muse Cond in Chantilly France. T his is essentially a pear shaped brilliant of just o ver nine carats given to Louis II Prince of Cond by French king Louis XIII probably in 1643 but it seems likely that it was cut into its present form sometime after that Balfour 2009 61. T he invention of the brilliant cut has also been attributed to an Italian Vincenzio Peruggi or Peruzzi. This attribution was seemingly rst voiced by Antoine Caire a French lapidary in 1826. He noted that with regard to the invention of the brilliant The information I have been able to obtain seems to give the glor y to Vincent Peruzzi of Venice who lived in the late seventeenth century Caire 1826 58 my translation from his French. Since then many have quoted Caire with regard to Peruzzi including Harry Emanuel Augusto Castellani and Edwin Streeter the latter in one case calling him Vincenzio Bruzzi Emanuel 1867 66 Castellani 1871 8687 Streeter 1877 25. More recently when researching his book on the history of diamond cutting the late Herbert Tillander could f ind no evidence for the existence of a Venetian diamond cutter called Peruggi or Peruzzi and considered him to be a myth. However considering Caires lapidary and gemological experience and the fact that he learned his lapidary craft as an ap170  The Early Brilliant CutFigure 9.4. A reproduction of the French Blue later recut and now known as the Hope Diamond. Credit  2016 Scott Sucher museumdiamonds.com. prentice in Turin Italy there may be something to his story. Tillander noted that he was planning to write the full story of Caires erroneous theory on the evolution of the Brilliant cut but unfortunately this does not seem to have been completed Tillander 1995 4. T he Brilliant Cut in London and the Low Countries We can probably date the introduction of the brilliant cut to around 166070 and probably to France but the brilliant cut soon also became closely associated with cutting in London. T he London Grub Street Journal on 12 February 1736 quoted T he Post Boy newspaper in recording the death the previous T he Early Brilliant Cut  171day of Mr. Sam Sheafe a diamond cutter who rst brought perfection to the brilliants etc. Sadly I have been unable to unearth either that issue of The Post Boy or any further details about Sheafe who in any case can hardly have been a role model for Jean Pitan in 1673 Paris let alone Cardinal Mazarin a decade earlier. Perhaps Samuel Sheafe wont join Vincenzio Peruzzi or Jules Mazarin in vying for recognition as the original inventor of the brilliant cut but it is a reminder that in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries London was a major diamond cuttin g center and as Harry Emanuel later recorded In England there used to be several cutters who were renowned for the excellence and perfection of their work and whose diamonds still called old English fetch a much larger price than any others Emanuel 1865 66. The Scottish scientist Sir David Brewster even went so far as to state that the brilliant form was invented in England Brewster 1832 575n. Rare praise from a Scot. In any case English cutters were experts in producing brilliant cut diamonds by the early 1700s. A datable example is the Regen t Diamond previously known as the Pitt Diamond see gure 9.3. The cutting of this large stone in London in 1706 is described in the next chapter. The Regent was bought by the French regent Philippe II Duke of Orlans in 1717 and mounted in the coronation crown of Louis XV in 1722. The crown was later dismantled but it can be seen in a detailed engraving by Sbastien Antoine gure 9.5. The Regent is lower center the Sancy is at the very top and the lozenge shaped diamonds that form the tops of the eurs de lys are e ight of the Mazarin diamonds. T he diamond set in a hair ornament gure 9.6 may well be a slightly earlier example of a surviving brilliant cut. The piece in its present form has been adapted from a ring bezel and may even originally have been a button but the underside of the set172  The Early Brilliant CutFigure 9.5.

The former owners of this ornament were the Dukes of St. Albans which supports the story of its origin because the rst Duke of St. Albans was an illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress Nell Gwyn Scarisbrick 1990 4243. T he center brilliant has been called a transitional cut between table and brilliant because of its simple pavilion facets but the pavilion seems fairly typical for an early square brilliant Antwerp 1993 19899 no. 90. T he jeweler and antiquary Mozes Heiman Gans quotes a Dutch archive of 1688 that included a jewelry set with a variety of diamonds described as brilliants including a bracelet with T he Early Brilliant Cut  173Figure 9.6. Diamond set hairpin co nverted from a ring. The inscription says the large early brilliant cut diamond was g iven by Charles II to his mistress Nell Gwyn.

Since other diamonds in this list are described as rose facet and table it seems likely that the brilliants were indeed such Gans 1961 425. Another inventory in Dutch a few years later than the one just quoted includes many brilliant diamonds but here the jewelry belonged to Mary II wife of William III of England so cutting in England is quite likely Gans 1961 42830. It is to be hoped that future study of Dutch and Belgian archives will throw more light on brilliant cutting there. T he Cutting of a Brilliant With its square form the center diamond of the Nell Gwyn bodkin seems to be remarkably close to the brilliant cut described in detail by David Je ries in 1750. He explains that the initial stage of cutting a brilliant diamond from an octahedral crystal was to re proporti on the octahedron by polishing down its vertical heightpoint to pointuntil it was equal to its width. T his gives an apex angle of ninety degrees the same as seen with point cuts as early as the fteenth century. The vertical height was then measured and the top cut down by 5 18 of the height to provide the table and the bottom ground down by 1 18 of the height to provide the culet. Once this was done the diamond was a complete square table diamond see gure 9.1. T he additional top crown and bottom pavilion facets were then added. If the angles and proportions described by Je ries were used then according to John Mawe the collet will play in the center of every facet Mawe 1823 7879. Indeed the gemologist Wilhelm Friedrich Eppler has shown that the relatively large culet as described by Je ries actually reects many rays which otherwise would have been lost for the brilliancy of the stone Eppler 1967. Typical rather high small tabled early br illiants can be seen in the enameled gold ring in gure 9.7. This has an illustrious history particularly relevant here. It was presented by Frederick Prince of Wales to the French jeweler and traveler John Chardin in 1736. John Chardin was familiar with Persia and India and knew JeanBaptiste Tavernier. As early as 1750 David Je ries illustrated round oval and pear  shaped brilliant cut diamonds as well as th e then standard square or cushion shaped brilliants  see gure 9.2. These brilliants are the true forerunners of the twentieth century brillian t indeed proportions changed little from the early eighteenth to later nineteenth centuries. Variants Proportion preferences varied from place to place as they still do to some extent. Mawe explained that many brilliant diamonds cut outside of England had a crown facet angle of fty degrees or more rather than the English forty ve d egrees T he Early Brilliant Cut  175Figure 9.7.  right  Enameled gold ring set with brilliant cut diamonds pr esented to the French jeweler and traveler John Chardin by Frederick Prince of Wales in 1736.

Figure 9.9.  opposite bottom  A demi brilliant. 3D image Jack Ogd en. 176  The Early Brilliant Cut in order to preserve weight. These could be recut in England with the increase in value compensating for loss in weight and the cost of labor. Impression of size was important to some however and Mawe complained Such stress is laid by modern fashion on the supercial extent of a brilliant that the old rules for proportioning its dimensions are now nearly obsolete the diamond cutters have almost discarded the use of measures and in forming the facets trust wholly to the eye Mawe 1823 80 6869. T here were also diamonds cut as simplied versions of the brilliant. Perhaps the most common of these simpler cuts was the star cut gure 9.8 left column. This cut certainly dates back to the early 1700s and was illustrated in the monumental French Encyclopdie ou Dictionnaire raisonn des sciences des arts et des mtiers Diderot et al. 1771 pl. 2 3032. This cut was described by Harry Emanuel in 1867 as the old English single cut also called star single cut Emanuel 1867 75. There was also what Emanuel called the single cut brilliant that had a square table anked by sixteen facets gure 9.8 right column also shown in the Encyclopdie Diderot et al. 1771 pl. 2 2729 Emanuel 1867 75. Emanuel says This is the old form of cutt ing. A version of the brilliantthe demi brilliant or half brilliantis somet imes encountered in older inventories. For example several are listed in the 1691 inventory of the French royal jewels Bapst 1889 38183. The French priest Nol Antoine Pluche described and illustrated the side view of what he labels le demi brillant also called brillonet in his monumental encyclopedia of natural history gure 9.9 Pluche 1748 34952. There is also a top and side view of such a stone in the plate of diamond cuts in the mid eighteenth century En cyclopdie ou Dictionnaire raisonn des sciences des arts et des mtiers Diderot et al. 1771 pl. 2 910. I am unaware of ever seeing such a demi brillant in jew elry and it can hardly have been attractive set either over a black bedding or after the late seventeenth century in an open setting. Extremely thin brilliants with all but at pavili ons are however seen in nineteenth century Indian jewelry where thin Indian lasks have been recut into brilliants. These typically have crowns far thicker than their pavilions which can be almost at. Despite their thinness these diamonds can look remarkably bright. Later variations of the brilliant include the so called Lisb on cut which has a more complex crown than a traditional brilliant cut but this was presumably at the earliest a mid eighteenth century innovation in the wake of the inux of Brazilian diamonds into Lisbon after 1725 Carvalho 2014. The earliest repr esentation of the Lisbon cut I have found is in 1850 by Charles Holtzap el in the lapidary section of his monumental six volume T urning and Mechanical Manipulation Holtzap el 1850 1332 33 and gs. 116668. T he Early Brilliant Cut  177Setting Brilliants Although some brilliants were set with closed backs the brilliant was best suited to the open backed set tings that came into widespread use from the later seventeenth century onward. An early reference to a diamond set  jour is seen in a 1663 commission by Louis XIV for a cross with the diamonds set in this manner Bapst 1889 354. Even then open backs were not a new phenomenon with diamonds. Roman diamond rings are almost all set with open backs open sides or both. It might be signicant that the various early diamond rings that originated further east in Afghanistan or Pakistan are not set in this way. Recutting Sixteenth century table c uts especially the frequent examples with chipped corners would have been ideal as raw material for recutting into brilliants. In an ideal case cutting one of Jeriess proportioned table cuts into a brilliant red uces the overall weight by only about 5 percent. By the early eighteenth century jewelers were routinely recutting the older table cut diamonds in to brilliants when proportions allowed. A surviving invoice from the London jeweler Louis Fury covers just such recutting gure 9.10. The entry for 18 November 1720 shown here includes By Cutting of 61 thick tables unto brilliants. T he thirty largest weighed a total of almost fteen caratsthus averaging just under two carats a stone. These cost 1 20 shillings per carat to recut. The remaining thirty one presuma bly far smaller cost just 1s 6p 0.075 apiece to recut. A further thirty one diamonds cost the same to recut as did the cutting of e ighteen thin tables into roses. Roses if deep could also be recut as brilliants with a relatively high loss in weight. As a result roses were valued at less per carat than brilliants. 178  The Early Brilliant CutSince the seventeenth century there have been variations and improvements to the brilliant. These have been well covered in numerous publicationsin particular American diamond specialist Al Gilbertsons recent study of the American brilliant cut Gilbertson 2007. Marcel Tolkowskys improved design for the facet angles of a brilliant changed cutting forever in 1919 and the introduction of mechanized sawing perhaps helped the development of new cuts such as the baguette and its trapezoidal and other relatives Tolkowsky 1919. It must be remembered that when you strip away the romance of diamonds and their glittering brilliance however the manual cutting of smaller stones is repetitive work. J. H. Browne described the realities of diamond cutting in Amsterdam in the 1870s Diamond cuttin g seems to me a most dismal trade. The hundreds of men I have seen engaged in the mills appeared wan and worn and melancholy as well they might with their perpetual and monotonous round of cheerless and consuming toil. To them each day is like every other day. The seasons and the years come and go and go and Figure 9.10.

T he Early Brilliant Cut  179come without chance or change. Their world is but a revolving disk the straining of the eye the tension of the nerves a painful pressure of the hand against the little gem J. H. Browne 1872 351. In the 1880s Arthur Scott and Lewis Atkinson noted the wages for diamond cutting in London women and girls for rose cutting 2535s per week cutters 3575s per week cleavers 50130s per week and polishers 40 120s per week. This was for a twelve hour day Scot t and Atkinson 1888 21. It is noteworthy that cleavers received the most. Modern technology has led to more precise regularity sizes proportions and brilliance. Computer programs plan how best to cut stones the proportions of the nal stone are graded by other computer programs. In these days of consistency and ideal cuts there are those who believe that the older less regular stones possess a beauty and individuality that modern production fails to match. This is not new. An unknown correspondent in the London Review a century and a half ago describing his impressions on seeing the Koh i Nur display ed at the 1862 Great Exhibition had no doubts. The Koh i Nur had been recut from i ts ancient Indian form ten years earlier and now was no more the luminous mound which delighted the eyes of the Moguls. It shows a huge face of diamond but in order to attain this vulgar attribute of size or spread it has been cut so thin that it is not a brilliant in the true sense of the word it is a thin slab of diamond with facettes cut on it in imitation of those of a brilliant Anon 1862. Although we can probably place the date of the introduction of the brilliant cut to within a decade or two after 1650 the name and even nationality of its inventor are so far unknown. T he faceted back and front of the brilliant provided great sparkle and re and it is not surprising that it soon eclipsed the once popular rose. The brilliant cut developed at the very time that the English and Dutch trading companies were bringing an increasing number of diamonds back from India. Englands major part in this trade and its acceptance of immigrant Jewish diamond dealers also established London as a major diamond cutting centeran often overlooked role that will be considered in the next chapter. L ondon is seldom thought of today as playing a major role in diamond cutting. In the past things were di erent. Diamonds had been entering Britain and being set in royal jewels at least since the mid 1200s but there is little evidence for cutt ing there until the later 1500s when cutting was encouraged even by Queen Elizabeth. Diamonds began to ow into England in greater abundance following the establishment of the East India Company in 1600 and within a couple of generations London had become a major cutting center. 10 Diamond Cutting in London T he earliest mention of commerce involving unset diamonds we hear of in England is a Roche diamont uncut diamond for which along with other gems and jewelry two Genoese merchants requested an import license into England in 1491 Rymer 1727 12 460. Th e document describes the stone as an amigdalat diamont presumably because its shape resembled an almond Latin amygdalus . In 1536 Sir John Gostwick Henry VIIIs treasurer paid Andrew Thomas merchant of Venice 1520 on the kings behalf for a diamond. This was an enormous sum of money in those days but the diamond was probably already cut Gairdner 1888 151. Some such diamonds came north overland across Europe others with the galleys that plied to Antwerp from Venice Brown 1864 cxli. The Venetian Bartolommeo di Pasi produced a comprehensive catalogue of the objects being traded to and from Venice around Detail of a portrait of King James I of England painted by John de Critz in 1604. The diamond hanging from the hat jewel is the Sancy. Credit National Galleries of Scotland PG 561. 1831500. Diamonds are mentioned only three times among the amazing variety of goods traded between cities all around the Mediterranean and up into northern Europe and only as goods traded from Venice. An export of diamonds to London is not mentioned but pointed diamonds went to Paris  diamanti in punta  some pointed diamonds went to Lisbon and various gems and also diamonds went to Antwerp Di Pasi 1521 192v 202r. Lenzen interpreted this to mean that point cut diamonds went to Paris and Lisbon while rough diamonds went to Antwerp to be cut there Lenzen 1970 61. This interpretation is not impossible but he could well be reading too much into a minor variation in wording. We might assume that the import of rough diamonds into England in the late fteenth century implies that diamonds were already being cut there. Indeed we have an English jewelers bill or pricing estimate probably dating to the beginning of Henry VIIIs reign or earlier thus no later than around 1520 for a ruby and diamond brooch the estimate included the polishing of the four diamonds Gairdner et al. 1929 1 15. It is possible that such stones may have needed to be sent abroad for polishing however when a box of diamonds was stolen in Portsmouth in 1523 or early 1524 it was found that they had been o ered for sale in London but as no man here could polish and dress them none would buy Gairdner et al. 1929 147. These diamonds were taken to Bruges instead. They had been on a Dutch ship sailing between Lisbon and Antwerp that sank near Chichester and were stolen by a beer brewer in Portsmouth from the master of the ship who had lodged with him. This is an early reference to the trade in diamonds from Lisbon to Antwerp where many Portuguese merchants had settled a trade link that became preeminent toward the end of the century Everaert 2004 46971. 184  Diamond Cutting in LondonDiamond Cutting in Portugal and Antwerp With the rise of Lisbon as a diamond center Venice and Genoa waned. De Pasis mention of diamonds sent from Venice to Lisbon shows that the city was a market for diamonds prior to or independent of the direct sea route to India that had been opened up by his time. Whether there was diamond cutting in Lisbon that early is uncertain but it was certainly established soon. Baltazar Cornejo was a diamond expert and cutter with the Casa da India the Lisbon authority that handled the East Indies trade in the 1530s Silva 1993 22. About this same time Jrg Herwart from Augsburg represented the Fugger banking company in Lisbon and had diamond cuttin g workshops there illustrating the strong commercial links between Lisbon and northern Europe Correia 2011. Later in the sixteenth century Philip Holbein the grandson of the German artist Hans Holbein was described as a diamond cutter and royal jeweler from Lisbon Thieme Becker 1907  s.v. H olbein Philipp I. Interestingly he is reported to have used a water powe red diamond cuttin g wheel Stetten 1779 144. A letter written in 1570 from an unnamed Antwerp merchant and diamond cutter to a fellow Antwerp craftsman explains that the writer had traveled to Lisbon and was staying there with a diamond cutter called Hans presumably a compatriot Butler 1903. He reported that Hans was now running only one of his two diamond cutting mills and of the twenty six or t wenty seven mills in the city only twelve were kept going. He adds Had I known there was no more work I should not have come hitherwards. . . . At Antwerp there is more work than here. This suggests that diamond cutting was fairly widespread in Lisbon up to the mid sixteenth centur y or so but then dwindled there with Antwerp in the ascendance. T here certainly was a major market in the north. In late 1587 Diamond Cutting in London  185news arrived in London from Antwerp that Alexander Farnese Duke of Parma the governor of the Spanish Netherlands and a highly accomplished military leader was making great preparations for war. To ensure he looked his best for the campaign the embroiders and diamond cutters in Antwerp work night and day Lomas and Hinds 1927 394. Earliest Cutting in London By the late 1500s diamond cutting was well established in London and rough diamonds were being brought there by Portuguese merchants. For example the jeweler Hannibal Gammon purchased a parcel of brutt diamonds that is rough diamonds from one in 1584 Gammon 1606 70r. Not all reached the London diamond cutters through o icial channels. The English were renowned as pirates or privateers depending on point of view. In 1592 English sailors including Sir Walter Raleigh intercepted the Portuguese ship Madre de Deus on its way back from the East Indies. The ship carrying perhaps the largest single treasure of gems ever taken was brought back to the port of Dartmouth. Jewelers merchants and crooks ooded to Dartmouth and most of the treasure was rapidly dispersed. One witness tells of seeing about 1800 diamonds from the treasure with just one man a Mr. Broadbent in Gravesend when it was inquired of him whether there might be a better market for the stones in Frankfurt or Venice Giuseppi 1892 254. One of those who rushed to obtain jewels from the Madre de Deus despite warnings against doing so was the London jeweler Hannibal Gammon Giuseppi 1892 255. A large rough diamond from this treasure valued at 2600 ended up with a Dutch diamond cutter who worked in a room on the second story of Hannibal Gammons house at The Horseshoe in Cheap in London Salisbury 1895 182. 186  Diamond Cutting in LondonGammons contemporary the merchant and government adviser Gerard Malynes may have played a part in establishing London as a cutting center. Of English descent Malynes was born in Antwerp and came to England in 1561. He was involved in the jewelry business and in the 1620s he wrote about the value and assessment of diamonds saying It is almost 40 yeares since I did maintaine divers milnes mills and cutters of Diamonds implying that he was so involved in the 1580s Malynes 1622 75. This might tie in with a commission from Queen Elizabeth in June 1587 to her jeweler John Spilman to take up diamond cutters ruby cutters agate cutters and other workmen at her Majestys prices Lemon 1865 418. T he diamond polishers who immigrated to London in the late sixteenth century were mainly Protestants from the Netherlands and France Goose and Luu 2006 Hofmeester 2013 38 39. The fall of Antwerp into Spanish hands in 1585 led to an exodus of Jews that is traditionally tied in with the rise of Amsterdam as a diamond cuttin g center. Edgar Samuel has pointed out however that although Jews were well represented among Amsterdam jewelers in the seventeenth century they were in a minority among the diamond cutters and polishers Samuel 197880. The same seems to have been true of London. The London based Jewish diamond t rading networks following the Resettlement of Jews in England in the 1650s have been studied in detail by Edgar Samuel and Gedalia Yogev Samuel 197880 2003 Yogev 1978. Cutting of Royal Diamonds A 1596 account gure 10.1 concerning the costs involved with two diamonds o ered to Queen Elizabeth I throws considerable light on a major diamond transaction involving cutting in London at the close of the sixteenth century Salisbury 1915 Diamond Cutting in London  187Figure 10.1.

Reproduced by permission of the Marquess of Salisbury Hateld House. 188  Diamond Cutting in London 58889. The account itemizes the cost of the rough diamonds foreign travel and payment to the cutter with board and lodging for him and his men for at least a year. The boartthat is the low quality diamond crushed to make abrasive to cut the two diamondscost 150 almost the same as the labor of cutting. In addition there was the cost of cutting models of the f inal diamonds in crystal presumably rock crystal that were used to show the queen what the nished diamonds would look like and the cost of setting those models in gold to show the queen the nal e ect. And lastly there was the price for setting the diamonds plus interest on it all. The account notes that the owners had received higher o ers in Frankfurt and from both the French ambassador and Sir Anthony Ashley then clerk of the Privy Council but preferred to see the diamonds in the queens hands. The mention of travel abroad and the need to pay for the cutters board and lodging suggests that the cutter and his associates were from overseas presumably the Low Countries brought to London to carry out the work. T he reference to cutting models of the proposed nal form of the diamonds in crystal and then setting these in gold is noteworthy. For those in the trade lead models were su icient to provide an idea of size and form as Fryer explained but when trying to tempt a potential purchaser of an important stone a f ine model in crystal was advisable Fryer 1698 21314. The same year that the diamond models were made for Elizabeth I in France Nicolas de Harlay Seigneur de Sancy sent a similar crystal model of the diamond that bears his name to the sultan in Constantinople hoping he might buy it. It was noted that the diamond itself could not be sent unless paid for Brown et al. 1897 215. This attempt at a sale of this fty four carat stone failed but eventually in 1604 the diamond was sold to King James I of England 160325 Elizabeth Is successor who was also King James VI of Scotland from 1567 to 1625 Balfour 2009 247. Among the Cecil papers at Hateld House the house built in 1611 by Robert Cecil rst Earl of Salisbury and chief minister to King James I and still the home of the Cecil family is a receipt noting that the Sancy Diamond had been received from M. de Beaumont ambassador from the king of France for the king of England James I on 10 March 1605. It gives the weight as fty three carats and explain s how the price of 60000 crowns would be paid in three installments a third immediately a third on 24 April and the rest the following year in March Giuseppi 1938 9192. The Sancy was one of the earliest diamonds cut in a sophisticated way perhaps as early as the later fteenth century and may even be a reincarnation of the Balle de Flandres. Jamess large diamond was added as a pendant to the Mirror of Great Britain jewel that the next year was described in the inventory of the jewels in the Tower of London A greate and ryche jewell of golde called the Myrror of Great Brytaigne conteyninge one verye fayre table dyamonde one verye fayre table rubye twoe other lardge dyamondes cutt lozengewise the one of them called the Stone of the letter H of Scotlande garnished with small dyamondes twoe rounde perles xed and one fayre dyamonde cutt in fawcettis bought of Sauncey Palgrave 1836 2305.

The Sancy was sold in 1657 by James II to Cardinal Mazarin who in turn bequeathed it to the French king. T he Heyday of London Diamond Cutting By the 1660s London had become a world center for the diamond trade. It was noted that 200000 of rough diamonds were entering England each year and that London was now the main cutting center no longer Amsterdam or Venice Grey Diamond Cutting in London  1911769 27289. There is now abundant evidence for diamond cutting in London and many of the cutters have Dutch or Flemish names. One such was Nicholas Maubert of St. Giless Cripplegate London the subject of legal action in the late 1670s regarding his recovery of a debt and then speaking contemptuous Words against the Protection of the Lord Chamberlain of His Majestys Household. One of his defenses was that he was a foreigner and unacquainted with the laws of England. This along with his name shows he was an immigrant but his lack of acquaintance with the laws of England seems a poor excuse. He was not new to England some four years earlier in December 1664 the diamond merchant John Cholmley had written to his brother Nathaniel recently arrived in India saying I thank you kindly for the Laske Indian cut diamond you sen t me Nic Maubert cut it and I would have had 12 for it But a friend gott it o  me Cholmley 166493 fol. 0131. Mention of the Laske is a reminder that a signicant number of the Indian diamonds imported into Europe had been cut in India but were considered too crude to be used without recutting. Such stones were almost certainly the diamonds without order or grace that the seventeenth century jewele r Robert de Berquen tells us were brought from India and recut.1 Maubert also jointly invested in diamonds with other London jewelers. For example the bankerjeweler Sir Francis Child bought rough diamonds in partnership with him and another jeweler. These diamonds were then polished and sold partly retail and partly into the trade Samuel 1977. The London based Dutch or Flemish sounding Jaspe r Cloek left a 1682 will instructing that his three diamond polishing Mills in the ga rrett and with all and singular the utensils materialls and appertenances should be sold to best advantage National Archives 1682 Prob. 11371. Having three mills suggests he had a fair amount of work. The same will also refers to seaventy ive 192  Diamond Cutting in Londonpounds due from Mr. Chomley Gent and the payment of anything that be found Justlie due and owing to Mr. Hendrick van Hoornesbeck sp of Anwerpe Merchant. This suggests that Jasper Cloek obtained diamonds from one or more Antwerp merchants. We can equate Mr. Chomley Gent with John Cholmley or less likely his brother Nathaniel who only returned to London from India in 1682. Nathaniel Cholmley also had an account with a Mr. Foster a diamond cutter who acted as a broker in some of his transactions Cholmley 166493 fol. 0077. Something of the business arrangements of a diamond cutter at this period can be seen from William Watsons 1794 Treatise of the Law of Partnership where he uses as an example the case of a 1730s partnership between the diamond cutter Philip Hubert and Robert Nelson a London diamond merchant Watson 1794 37144. Although of early eighteenth rather than late seventeenth century da te the basics were probably little changed. Hubert agreed to cut diamonds for Nelson and to be involved in the buying and selling of the diamonds. He would provide 100 for buying the machinery and 400 toward buying rough diamonds for their mutual benet and advantage. After agreed deductions half of the prot and loss was to be divided and sustained between them. It didnt go well Hubert and Nelson went bankrupt in 1739. T he same Treatise of the Law of Partnership noted that fourteen shillings per carat was to be allowed for the cutting. A century earlier the cost of cutting and polishing a diamond had been twenty shillings a carat Southey 1819 892. This reduction in cutting costs might have related to the cheaper boart that became available from Brazil after the early 1730s. Boart diamond too awed for gem use was not evenly distributed in nature as it is broken down by river born tran sport. In India it was not abundant and was relatively expensiveCholmley Diamond Cutting in London  193notes a price as high as six or seven shillings a carat in India Cholmley 166493 fol. 0060 and 0076. The cost of the boart needed to cut the two large diamonds for Queen Elizabeth in 1596 as noted above was high at 150. As we will see later the diamond dust required just over a century later for the cutting of Thomas Pitts large diamondlater the Regent Diamond cost 1400. Successful business attracts taxation and so it was that in 1670 the English Parliament had debated the possibility of imposing a tax on the import of rough diamonds. This tax doesnt seem to have been imposed but two decades later taxes were introduced to help the country fund the war against France. T hese measures included a Duty of Twenty Shillings for every Hundred Pounds Value of all Diamonds Pearls Rubies Emeralds and other Jewels and precious Stones imported after the Twenty fth Day of D ecember 1692 Raithby 1819 38087. T hat equated to a 1 percent duty on the declared value of the gems this value being a irmed by the Oath of the Importer. Predictably we hear soon of a package of diamonds seized at import. They had been entered with a declared value of 500 but were suspected of being worth 10000 Redington 1868 318. Mr. Pitts Diamond Perhaps the largest diamond cut in London around 1700 was the one that Sir Thomas Pitt president of Madras sent back from India with his son Robert in 1702. This diamond was eventually sold to Philip Duke of Orleans a nephew of Louis XIV and regent to the young Louis XV and thenceforth the diamond bore the name  Regent Diamond see gure 9.3. It had been o ered previously to much of the royalty in Europe including the British Queen Anne but rejected as too costly. That no other European royalty could a ord it induced the Duke 194  Diamond Cutting in Londonof Orleans to buy it as a matter of French honor. A considerable amount is known of this stonesome myth some fact ranging from its original discovery a probably fanciful story of it being smuggled from the mine in a leg wound and its journey to London and eventual sale. What is relevant here is the copious information regarding its cutting C. N. Dalton 1915 27087 Hedges 1889 cxxvcxlvii Lawson 1905 1750. Pitts large diamond is variously recorded as weighing 410 and 426 carats rough. There were surface aws apparent but on the basis of a window polished on the stone to allow observation of the interior it seemed clear inside. Robert Pitt wrote to his father in December 1703 to say that the diamond was with the cutter Mr. Cope. We can note that some writers refer to the cutter as Harris presumably meaning Jeremiah Harris a diamond cutter of London whose 1718 will survives National Archives PROB 11562 but the surviving Pitt correspondence refers only to Mr. Cope. Perhaps Harris worked with or for Cope. This was the London cutter Joseph Cope of St. Stephen Walbrook London. Many of his bills of exchange and receipts some of his correspondence other business papers and his will have survived National Archives Kew Will PROB 20597. His business must have been considerable. Edgar Samuel has shown how between 1698 and 1704 Joseph Cope cut an average of 10000 worth of diamonds a year for banker and goldsmith Sir Francis Child Samuel 1977 51. The records of Childs business also reveal that he bought smaller cut diamonds from Antwerp or Amsterdam because they were cheaper than those cut in London a price disparity that would eventually contribute to Londons decline as a diamond cuttin g center. In any case Cope soon realized that the aws in Thomas Pitts diamond actually extended quite deep into the stone meaning that more had to be cut o  to make it usable. The cutting of the diamond was completed in early 1706 having taken Diamond Cutting in London  195just over two years. To the dismay of Pitt the total weight of the nal cushion shaped brilliant  see gure 9.3referred to as a brillionwas reported to be 140 carats a third of its original weight. In the cutting process several pieces were sawn o  these chips removed were valued at 8000. The diamond dust required for the cutting cost 1400 and the cost of cutting was 5000about 12 a carat. These gures were quoted in Gentlemans Magazine in 1776 vol. 46 105 and there seems no reason to doubt them. Lead models were made of the rough and of the stone during cutting and these survive in the collection of the Natural History Museum London Bari and Sautter 2001 191. These models were also represented in a watercolor by Dutch born art ist Jan van Rymsdyk in 1772 gure 10.3 and a version of this illustration was used in Jan and Andreas van Rymsdyks Museum Britannicum of 1778. Below the lead models in gure 10.3 is shown Pitts diamond as nally cut. The bottom of the gure shows the Florentine yellow diamond. Cope was also asked to cutt two or three in crystalthat is models of the nished gem to show prospective customers. Several models of Pitts diamond are in old collections but perhaps most of glass. There was a rock crystal model of the diamond in the collection of the eighteenth century Scot tish physician and collector William Hunter. This model now in the Hunterian Museum of the University of Glasgow is not inconceivably one of Copes originals.2 Pitt was particularly hoping Queen Anne would buy his diamond for the honor of me and my posterity but eventually it was sold to the French regent in 1717 for two million livres which has been estimated at the equivalent of just over 133000 thenclose to the London jeweler David Je riess statement that the diamond sold for 135000. The price equates with slightly less than 1000 a carat. From the start Pitt had been adamant that his stone would be worth 1500 a carat when 196  Diamond Cutting in LondonFigure 10.3.

However since that Company has been discouraged this Trade has greatly sank and by Consequence the Workers cutters of them must cease too the more to our Disrepute Houghton 1727 7374. Records cannot tell us how often merchants managed to avoid the import duty but we hear of attempts that failed such as in 1721 when the English Ipswich Journal reported that merchants trying to smuggle 125 large Diamonds and two large Emeralds of immense value into London from Holland had their gems seized 29 April 1721. T he duty was undoubtedly an impediment to the cutting trade but the political will to remove it only came around 1730 when diamonds from India were joined by those the Portuguese brought in increasing numbers from the newly discovered mines in Brazil. It was imperative that London should play a major role in this expanding trade. In 1732 Lord Tyrawley then envoy to Portugal addressed the British government on behalf of Portuguese merchants a ected by the duties When Diamonds were only found in the East Indies the Settlement which our Country has at Fort St. George later Madras now Chennai had almost brought the whole Diamond Trade into the hands of the English so that London within these thirty Years is become the rst Market for them in Europe and upon that account the best Diamond Cutters having come over and settled there it has been for a long time the place where Diamonds especially Brilliants are cut in the greatest perfection National Archives Kew SP 8937 2 May 1732 partially quoted in Southey 1819 892. Lord Tyrawley went on to note the competition I am told they cut and polish Diamonds very well in Amsterdam great quantities especially of small ones are cut in Antwerp. In Paris they cut Diamonds very well there are also Diamond cutters in Venice and Hamburg Southey 1819 892. That same year A Petition of Several Merchants of the City of London . . . and other Traders and Dealers in Diamonds was presented to the House of Commons asking for the duty to be scrapped as duly noted in Journal of the House of Commons for 26 February 1732. Lord Tyrawley and the merchants petition had the desired result with An Act for the Free Importation and Exportation of Diamonds Pearls Rubies Emeralds and all other Jewels and Precious Stones passed in March 1732 and taking e ect from April 1733.4 T here was a diamond business in London through the eighteenth century from which many records survive Samuel 1977 2003 Yogev 1978 Vanneste 2011 2015. Many London eighteenth century c utters names are known but Amsterdam Diamond Cutting in London  199was becoming an increasingly signicant city for diamond cutting while in London cutting was dwindling. Tijl Vanneste has recently written about the extensive diamond dealin gs of the London merchant James Dormer who moved to Antwerp and his trade networks with Lisbon Amsterdam and elsewhere based largely on correspondence preserved in Antwerp Vanneste 2011 2015. Dormer had most of his diamonds cut in Amsterdam. Price seems to have been the main issue and continued to be so. In 1813 the British mineralogist John Mawe still held English diamond cutters to be the best but admitted that their numbers were so small as to occasion many stones to be sent to Holland where from the greater number and more active competition of the artists the price of workmanship is considerably lower Mawe 1813 5960. In his second edition ten years later he was more succinct The Dutch have engrossed almost all the trade as we are unable to compete with their prices labour being so much lower in Holland Mawe 1823 82. In 1849 it was widely reported in the British press that There is only one diamond cutter in London for example Worcester Journal 2 August 1849. In 1852 the Koh i Nur th e Mountain of Light diamond acquired by the British crown from Maharajah Duleep Singh was recut. This operation was undertaken at Garrard the crown jewelers in London with the Duke of Wellington inaugurating the work by himself cutting the rst facet gure 10.5. Garrard had to obtain advice on the cutting and perhaps to national shame consulted Mr. G. Coster of Amsterdam the trade of diamond cuttin g having entirely left this country and being at present chiey conned to Holland  Illustrated London News 24 July 1852. Two skilled workmen were brought from Holland to do the work. A few years later an anonymous writer in the American weekly Appletons Journal commented One hundred years ago England cut almost all the diamonds of the world but strange to say early 200  Diamond Cutting in LondonFigure 10.5.

In the center the Duke of Wellington starts the process. in this century the entire business was transported to Holland and now Amsterdam monopolizes this trade nearly altogether Anon 1871. In 1696 John Houghton decried the drop o in Englands diamond t rade that was already noticeable by then but suggested that there was considerable business opportunity in promoting the wearing of diamond jewelry. As he philosophically noted Every Dog has his Day and every nation its Fate Had we continud growing as we then grew we had by this time been a Monster and its probable most of our Neighbors would have been afraid of us. But however the best way to re gain that Trade is to have them diamonds in fashion in a high Degree. T his will incite an industry to procure them and much encrease our Trade at home to get materials to purchase them with or to buy Money that shall do it.

Diamond Cutting in London  201I n the past as today diamonds were a sign of wealth if not wealth itself and their value was of concern to dealers and owners alike. We have details of diamond prices dating back more than a millennium and actual price lists for at least half of this periodand formulae for calculating values. Value of course depends on size and quality and as we shall see in this chapter we have explanations of the criteria for judging diamonds ranging in date from some of the earliest Indian texts up to the remarkably contemporary sounding instruc tions of Sir William Perry in the later 1600s. 11 T he Value and Assessment of Diamonds Diamond Prices in the Ancient and Medieval World T he classical world provides little data on the value of diamonds other than when the Roman poet Marcus Manilius in the early f irst century AD said that diamond was more valuable than gold. A generation later Pliny called it the most valuable of all human possessions Manilius Astronomica 4.926 Pliny Natural History 37.15. This is minimal information but as the Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orta pointed out a millennium and a half later these classical writers were neither jewelers nor lapidaries Markham 1913 343. Early Islamic writers provide some pricing evidence. Al Kindi according to al Brn said One mithqal of it diamond the size of the grain of a pepper fetches a price of eighty dinars. I have not seen a stone bigger than the pine nut. The bigger pieces are three to four times costlier than the smaller ones Said 1989 80. The mithqal had an average weight See gure 11.3. 203of about 4.25 grams which was also the weight of a gold dinar coin. This allows us to say that in very approximate terms and assuming peppercorns then compare in size with those today a diamond of around 0.4 carats would then have been valued at the equivalent of about seven grams of gold. Ahmad ibn Yusuf al Tifashi the early thirteenth century Arabic p oet and author of a comprehensive book on minerals also quotes al Kindi but notes that the price of eighty dinars a mithqal was for the most expensive diamonds the cheapest diamonds on sale in Baghdad were just fteen dinars a mithqal but it is uncertain whether this applied to smaller size or poorer quality or both Abul Huda 1998 120. Al Brn also reported th e Razi brothers as saying that a dirham of the small grains of diamond were priced at 100 dinars  Said 1989 80. These Razi brothers were presumably the Baghdad born scholar Sha rif Razi AD 9701015 and his slightly older but equally erudite brother popularly known as Alam al Huda. The dirham was about three grams so their value was more than half again as much as al Kindis top price had been just over a century earlier. The Razis also seem to say that a larger single diamond was worth one thousand dinars. If they mean a single diamond weighing a dirham that would be one of fteen carats. Tifashi explained that the average price for a diamond in his day was two dinars a carat thus the equivalent of about 8.5 grams of gold but that if a rare large stone of half a mithqal just over ten carats suitable for a nger ring is found its value is double that of the mustard seed size three times the f illa seed and four and ve times more Abul Huda 1998 120. A per carat pr ice of just double that of the mustard seed si ze seems far too low possibly his text is actually a reference to the square rule of diamond pricing as discussed below. In India the primary source of diamonds to the ancient and medieval worlds there was a mercantile approach from an early period. The prices given in the Ratnapariksa of Buddha Bhatta 204  Value and Assessment of Diamondsand the Brhatsamhita of Varahamihira escalate with the size of the diamond but the underlying formulae are not clear Finot 1896 11 62. However in the Agastimata of uncertain date but pre fourteenth century  a base price per carat is multiplied by four times the weight minus one. Thus a dealer deciding a fair base price for a certain stone is twenty units a carat would price an eight carat one a t 20  4  8  1  560 units Finot 1896 xxixxxx. In the early fourteenth century the Indian mint master and math ematician Thakkura Pheru listed prices for small diamonds on the basis of how many together weighed a gumja a weight of about 0.76 carats Sarma 1984. If we make a very approximate calculation based on contemporary silver coinage and modern silver values a 0.1 carat diamond would have cost about 0.025 a 0.2 carat one a bout 0.1 and a 0.4 carat o ne 0.4. These prices seem far lower than the medieval Islamic prices. On the other hand larger stones were far more highly priced. According to the values Pheru gives in gold coinage the value of a 1.5 carat diamond w ould be the equivalent of about 130 grams of gold an eighteen carat stone well over one hundred kilograms of gold Sarma 1984 76. T he high prices for large diamonds in India as well as the apparent embargo on their export prior to the later medieval period as described earlier explains why the diamonds reaching Europe were in the main very small. The two diamonds owned by Richard de Blountesham seemingly a wealthy London taverner at the time of his death in 1317 were valued just at six shillings and eight pence 0.33 Riley 1868 124. They must have been minute. Fifty years later in April 1367 a couple unsuccessfully demanded the return of certain goods that they said had been left for safekeeping. Included were six gold rings with gems identied as sapphires rubies and one dyamand. The value given for all six rings was just 2.65 Thomas 1929 75. With the later fourteenth century came diamond cutting Value and Assessment of Diamonds  205which had a great impact on pricing. The earliest European Figure 11.1. First page of a 1572 list of diamond prices by Juan de Arfe y Villafae. Credit From de Arfe 1572. document to give separate prices for cut and uncut diamonds seems to be that written by a Jewish gem merchant in Venice in 1403 Sirat 1968. Here rough was half the price weight for weight of the well cut sto nes with prices increasing exponentially with weight but not according to any precise rule that I can discern. The reader was advised that the prices were for good quality stones and to be careful to avoid faults and check that the faces of th e octahedral rough stones are harmoniously ordered. With poorer quality the writer wisely recommends to look twice before buying and buy them cheap. One thing to look out for he tells us was a glaz in the stonethe Yiddish term gletz is still used in the diamond industry to describe small f issures. Once into the sixteenth century the direct sea route to India supplemented the overland routes and Portugal started to play a prominent role in the diamond trade. In 1572 Juan de Arfe y Villafae 15351603 a goldsmith and artist of German origin living and working in Spain published a book on assaying and included the weights of gems. In this he gives the prices in gold ducats for cut diamonds and several other gems in sizes from one to ten carats gure 11.1. The columns show carats  Quilatos  and grains  Granos  a grain being one quarter of a carat. Since the gold ducat was 3.5 grams of near enough pure gold we can gain a good idea of diamond prices in relative terms gure 11.2. With a gold price today of about 40 per gram in relative terms a one carat diamond w ould be 7000 a ve carat one a bout 175000. T he Square Rule De Arfes diamond prices follow the square rule which became widespread in sixteenth century Europe. D e Arfe has a 206  Value and Assessment of DiamondsFigure 11.2. Diamond prices of 1572 from Juan de Arfe y Villafae see gure 11.1 calculated in terms of grams of gold. Graph Jack Ogden. base price of fty ducats per carat. Thus a one carat diamond w ould be worth fty ducats a two carat diamond 50  2  2  200 duca ts a three carat one 50  3  3  450 duca ts and so on. 1 One of the earliest European mentions of this square rule can be found in the Livro de Duarte Barbosa written around 1516 although this was for rubies sold in India not diamonds for which Barbosas prices escalate in a more linear way Barbosa 1866 20914. This may suggest that the square rule originated in India. When Richard Hakluyt the English writer and collector of early travelers accounts noted diamond prices at the end of the sixteenth century he gave them in Portuguese reales. His prices diered between fully cut pointed probably meaning uncut and chapas that is cleavage fragments or thin Indian cut tables where there was gaine made by workinge them Jones 1850 15859. Hakluyts prices range from uncut diamonds weighing just a fteenth of a carat to one carat pe rfect diamonds worked on all sides at 25000 reales. For diamond above a carat Hakluyt says that prices rise double in vallew value presumably a reference to the square rule. T he British travel writer and surgeon John Fryer writing in 1698 explains that in pricing diamonds the square rule 208  Value and Assessment of Diamondsshould be accurately observed and provides one of the more detailed descriptions of its application Fryer 1698 294. Like Juan de Arfe y Villafae he notes how diamond weights involving fractions of a carat were calculated. The smallest fraction used was one quarter of a carat a grain and the square rule applied. With a base price of 10 per carat a diamond of one quarter of a carat one grain was worth 10  14  14  0.625. Similarly a half carat stone was worth 10  12  12  2.5. For larger stone weights involving fractions the weight was rst converted to grains and then multiplied by the grain price. Thus with a carat base price of 10 as above a 1.25 carat diamond w ould be ve grains and this squared and multiplied by 0.625 gives 15.625. Due to misprints or copying errors the gures given by Fryer do not always tally but he explains the procedure clearly. T he square rule was by no means always applied and in any case fell out of favor during the eighteenth century although it was in use for natural pearls until quite recently I remember being taught it myself. In his 1751 second edition of A Treatise on Diamonds David Je ries still described the square pricing rule. A footnote in the fourth edition of 1871 comments The mode of calculating the value of stones has since the days of Je ries undergone considerable modications and it is di icult now to lay down any exact rule of valuation Je ries 1871 25. Renaissance Pricing An early and comprehensive description of diamond values and assessment in the English language is that of Gerard Malyness Lex Mercatoria The law merchant. This was rst published in 1622 and reprinted not always accurately several times over the following decades. Malynes is a particularly reliable source because he was a merchant had spent time in Antwerp was a govValue and Assessment of Diamonds  209ernment adviser on trade and had himself run diamond cuttin g mills. He describes di erent cuts of diamon ds prices of rough and cut price variations with color and other essential factors necessary for those wishing to trade in diamonds Malynes 1622 74 77. Malyness work thus stands as a snapshot of the diamond market around 1600 at a time when the English and Dutch East Indian Companies were about to change the balance of power in the European diamond trade. He rst lists prices for small diamonds noting that he had drawn this information from that set down at Paris in France during the reign of the French King Henry the fourth by the Jewelers there. Henry IV reigned from 1589 to 1610. This list covers rough diamonds weighing from 0.1 to 4 carats with prices given in French crowns per carat. From the rate of exchange he gives a 0.1 carat diamond w ould be worth 0.15 for convenience prices here are given in decimals of a pound rather than in the pounds shillings and pence used in the past. In the same list a one carat rough diamond w as the equivalent of 5.7 a two carat diamo nd 18 and a four carat 72. In co ntrast to this theoretical list he gives the prices actually paid for rough diamonds bought at Lisbon at about the same time that the Parisian jewelers list was compiled 0.0625 for a 0.1 carat diamond up to 3.7 5 for one carat na yfe uncut diamonds and 3.125 for one carat at sto nes presumably cleavage fragments or at Indian cut stones. Els ewhere he says that a at rough stone was valued at a third less than a pointed one. T here was always an element of a gamble when buying rough because as Malynes says it was uncertain what may be diminished of the Weight by the Workmanship of it but things were more certain for cut stones. For cut diamonds Malynes gives prices in English pounds with a one carat one a t 30 a two carat one a t 60 and a four carat one a t 200. The di erences between rough and cut prices reect not just a dealers prots 210  Value and Assessment of Diamondsbut the often signi cant loss in weight during cutting as well as the actual cost of cutting which he says was 0.5 to 0.6 per carat. Diamonds over four carats were rare because Malynes tells us hitherto they had all belonged to the kings in the places were  sic  they were found. He also explains the square rule for pricing. In the example he gives there is a base price of 25 per carat so a ten carat diamond w ould be 25  10  10 or 2500. He says that cut diamonds over ten or twelve carats in weight were too rare to be subject to such a formulaic approach and were sold by estimation as the love and fancy of a man will carry the same. Malynes explains perhaps unexpectedly that pointed Diamonds had previously been cheaper than table cuts because there was less waste in cutting but were now deerer and more esteemed Malynes 1622 76. He also notes that demand would a ect prices for example a rise in price might be brought about by the marriages of Princes and great People. John Fryer said that on average a diamond would lose just a third of its weight in cutting and that Rough Brute or Uncut Stones are in Value half the price of Cut or Polished Stones. However the cutting of Nathaniel Cholmleys great stone of sixty carats wasted near two thirds and Pitts diamond later the Regent Diamond about the same as we saw in the previous chapter. To get an idea of the nal size that might be cut from a large piece of rough a cast of the rough diamond could be made in lead and then led to determine the best eventual shape and size. Fryer explained that the weight of the nal diamond could be calculated because of lead being exactly three times as heavy as a diamond Fryer 1698 21314. However perfect lead must be used not the much lighter tin he may mean a lead tin alloy and th e lead should be second lead not rst lead. In practice lead has a specic gravity slightly more than three times that of diamond but if second lead Value and Assessment of Diamonds  211meant lead with a small tin addition then the formula could be accurate. Other mentions of the use of lead casts in this way include a mention from 1530 in a document of Franois I of France 151547 perhaps the earliest and Johannes de Laet in 1631 Bapst 1889 18 de Laet 1647 6. A few years later the Portuguese lapidary Baltasar Cornejo made two lead casts of a large diamond to determine how best to cut it to avoid an inclusion Crespo 2015 35. Among surviving examples is the lead cast of the French blue from the French crown jewels which allowed researchers to determine that the Hope Diamond could indeed have been cut from it Farges et al. 2009. Figure 10.3 shows lead models of the Regent or Pitt Diamond made before and during cutting. Lead casts would only have been made when relatively large diamonds were being cut. T he jeweler Hannibal Gammon who bought rough diamonds and employed diamond cutters gives a list of diamond prices in his 1606 Gouldesmytthes Storehouse. This list is headed Value of diamonds . . . bought at Goa in the Indies Gammon 1606. William Heth a clerk of his majestys store for the navy at Portsmouth not a jeweler repeated the same list in his The Goulden Arte or The Jewel House of Gemes but left o that dening heading Heth 1603 63v64v. David Humphrey a jewelry historian has suggested that the production of these works by Gammon and Heth marked changing attitudes to the dispersion of what had previously been considered as knowledge about the goldsmiths art to be ercely guarded and kept secret Humphrey 2010. Other Costs As a modern jewelry appraiser would tell you value is a ected by place. The seventeenth  century Armen ian historian Arakel of Tabriz knew this when he said that not all jewelers in di er212  Value and Assessment of Diamondsent lands value them diamonds in the same manner Bournoutian 2006 457. There will be huge variation between the price a merchant might pay at the mines in India and what a jeweler in Lisbon Paris or London would pay. And prices were always subject to negotiation particularly with larger stones. T he French traveler Jean de Thvenot described the prices normally paid for di erent sizes of diamonds at the diamond trading center of Golconda in India then noted However the price is not xt for one day I saw fty crowns a Mangelin payed for a Diamond of ten Mangelin and the next day there was but four and forty a Mangelin payed for another diamond that weighed fteen Mangelin Thvenot 1687 98. In another case a diamond ring was valued by three dierent jewelers two assessed it at 25 the third at about 35 Foster 1923 274. Europeans might also pay higher prices than other nationalities. According to the early sixteenth century J awhir Nma you could buy a good quality t wo carat diamond in th e market at what is now Kalaburagi some two hundred miles due west of Hyderabad for ten orins a carat and sell it to the Europeans for forty Digby 2008. Alternatively you could buy a rough diamond at four orins a carat get it cut by a European cutter and resell it in India for fteen orins Digby 2008. The version of Jawhir Nma publish ed by James Prinsep says you could buy a two carat sto ne for seven orins a carat and sell it for fteen when cut Prinsep 1832 355. Cutting here might have been very basic since potential weight loss would render more sophisticated cutting less economically tempting. Arakel of Tabriz repeated almost exactly the same information about buying in India sending it to Europeans to cut and then reselling at a prot that although probably out of date by his time is further indication of a common source for these texts Bournoutian 2006 458. Once back in Europe there were other costs that inuValue and Assessment of Diamonds  213enced the selling price of a diamond. When diamonds worth 921.01.11 were sent to London in 1668 the charges included East India Company permission at 1 percent various porterage charges plus the cost of an iron chest totaling 10.6.3 Cholmley 166493 fol. 0141. Greater expense accompanied the sale of a large diamond to Queen Mary II co ruler with William III in 168990 as recorded in a handwritten note preserved in the British Library Add. Ms. 44925 fols. 6775. The seller was Sir William Langhorne but others were involved. T he total price was 12338.15.6. Of this 10000 for the diamond itself was divided between Langhorne and others. The balance covered costs ranging from gratuities and exchequer fees to 9.11.0 for Coach hyre to Hampton Court  to the Exchequer  Lord Portlands c several times. A certain Lord and a Lady received signicant sums of money but their names were deliberately obliterated for reasons that can only be surmised and nally there was a Commission for Sale of the said Diamond at 112 per cent 180.0.0. In addition the hazard and risqu of cutting and apparently the cutting charge itself were borne by the sellers. The note does not mention the weight of this stone only that Its exceeding greatness takes away all Defects if any. That which is above all weight rule  measure cannot be subjected or estimated by ought but it Selfe or its equal which is noe where to bee had or found for fty thousand Pounds. The stone would be cut as her Majesty commanded and it having soe great a light in it will appear play with the greater vigor of one that they have asked 30000. It would they said make a perfect hart heart for the head or breast. Assuming we ignore the protestations that the stone was worth far more and take 12000 to represent a fair price for the cut stone it probably weighed around thirty ve carats when cut. The diamond was paid for in irregular installments by the exchequer between 7 January and 22 September 168990. 214  Value and Assessment of DiamondsT he costs involved in JeanBaptiste Taverniers sixth and nal diamond buying tr ip to the East in the 1660s included a ne imposed by Ottoman customs oicials and a commission to Jean Pitan for his help in selling the diamonds to Louis XIV Ogden 2017. These costs were shared between the Parisian merchants who nanced Taverniers purchases. T he Florentine Diamond Records of sales at the top end of the market often to European royalty can sometimes throw light on transactions involving diamonds that exist today as we saw with the Sancy and Pitt Diamonds in the previous chapter. In the British Library there survives a copy of an Italian letter dated 18 October 1599 presumably to the Grand Duke of Tuscany from the Cardinal del Monte concerning the dukes negotiation for a diamond of great value belonging to the Count di Monsachio presumably meant or misread for Monsanto Lansdowne MS 10546 fol. 40. This was what we know as the Florentine Diamond now in Vienna a yellow diamond that Tavernier says he had been shown several times and of which he provides a drawing Ball 1889 298. This gem shown at the bottom of gure 10.3 was said to have been given to the Portuguese governor in Goa by the King of Narsinga. Cardinal del Monte represented the interests of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and facilitated this transaction completed in 1601 by which Ferdinand Duke of Tuscany paid 35000 gold crociati crusadoes for the stone  Efemeridi 1781 6 January 1781 4. This Great Dukes faire diamond which he keeps under lock and key was seen by Richard Lassels a priest who traveled through Italy and wrote of his experiences. He notes that the diamond was absolutely the fairest in Europe weighed 138 carats and was almost an inch thick. He says that he described it to a famous jeweler in Value and Assessment of Diamonds  215Lyon France who valued it at a hundred thousand crownes between marchant and marchant and a hundred and fty thousand crownes between Prince and Prince Lassels 1670 183. T his is a reminder that value depends on whether one is buying or selling and to whom and as Garcia de Orta had wisely said on the will of buyers and the need for them Markham 1913 342. Every sale needs a willing buyer and a willing seller. Price Fluctuations Copious documentation allows us to see the price uctuations for more commercial sizes of diamonds through the seventeenth century. Hugh Greete the East India Companys diamond buyer in Borneo between 1613 and 1618 and seemingly aptly described as by profession a jeweler but in practice a juggler complained in 1615 that he didnt know what to pay for diamonds and was thus forced to buy them here at haphazard and not knowing whether I overrated them or not having been long out of England in which time for ought that I know the prices of them may alter Foster 1899 257 Ogden 2005. The T hirty Years War that a ected much of Europe between 1618 and 1648 has been blamed for a fall in diamond prices. In 1672 war in Europe is again blamed for a diminishing of the diamond trade but about this same time Sir William Petty countered this by saying that diamond prices could go up When they are bought up on feare of war Cholmley 166493 0153 British Library Ms. Add. 72897 14 105. In spring 1659 diamonds were despicable in England by reason of their glut hardly a ording their prime cost and prices appear to have remained depressed through the 1660s Foster 1921 203. A letter from John Cholmley in London to his brother in India written in November 1668 talks about Dyamonds being now very cheap here London Cholmley 166493 0142. The same year he 216  Value and Assessment of Diamondsalso said that diamonds weighing between half a carat and two carats were most in demand but they had to be of good quality as ordinary ware will not sell larger stones were relatively cheap Cholmley 166493 01400141. In 1670 diamonds were soo deare in India because of the quantities exported and a year later cheaper than formerly in England because there were few rough diamonds imported that year into Holland and none into Portugal Cholmley 166493 0147 01500151. The prot was largely in the cutting for which London was then the center and John Cholmley added I am resolved not to show them good large diamonds to any person rough but to cut them and make the most of them. The East India Company Court Minutes in September and December 1678 refer to a rise in prices of diamonds in India but this was short lived Sainsbury and Ottewill 1938 209 234. In 1682 Nathaniel Cholmley wrote from St. Helena nally en route home from India to those still in India telling them to ignore his previous instructions to invest in diamonds because prices were much fallen in Londonnews that he had presumably heard via an outward bound ship at St. Helena. We can sense the anxiety in his letter It is my request desire and order that if when this comes to your hands you have made no Investment in Dyamonds you desist from making any Cholmley 166493 fols. 00500051. This fall in diamond prices in London in 1682 is revealed by numerous documents in the Cholmley letters and East India Company records Cholmley 166493 fols. 00520053 0060 0067. The market continued very dull and low in 1683 but it seems this was for fairly large diamonds because small under 7 or 8 grains are desired and rather under 6 grains than bigger Cholmley 166493 fol. 0076. Another letter of December 1683 says the Marketts for good diamonds are very low here and bad ones are a very despicable comoditt  sic  Cholmley 166493 fols. 00770078. Value and Assessment of Diamonds  217Judging Quality As these remarks about quality show assessing a diamond by size was not everything. Color clarity and cut were important these three along with carat weight being the four Cs of recent diamond marketing and grading. We have already encountered early Indian texts that discuss the colors and clarities of diamonds. Di erent colors were associated with di erent castes or wear on dierent parts of the body and diamonds with internal aws were to be avoided. The re had obviously been a long need for those who could assess the quality and thus value of gems in India. Pheru in the fourteenth century for example explained the various things to look for in diamonds and described properties that could help establish their genuineness including hardness and even specic gravity Sarma 1984 4653. He explained that experts who understood both the theory and practice of gems were termed Mandalikas although this occupation was not open to those of low caste with physical deciencies or of obvious disrepute Sarma 1984 72. Understanding gems was even a useful talent for young ladies as the Kama Sutra tells us an old Indian text better known for its other instructional content Burton 1883 chap. 3. Naturally the jewel loving M ughals needed the relevant experts. The emperor Aurangzeb for example had at hand three specialists one a Persian seemingly with overall responsibility for the emperors gems another Persian who concerned himself with the monetary aspects and a third who was a member of Indias merchant caste a bania who could assess quality and spot imitations Azz 1942 142. T he man in gure 11.3 is apparently such an expert. He is weighing the gems probably including diamonds belonging to Rustam Khan d. 1658 who was an important military personage under Shah Jahan. This small painting is from the border of a portrait of Rustam Khan itself a page from an impressive 218  Value and Assessment of DiamondsFigure 11.3. Detail of the border in a Mughal album showing a specialist weighing the gems of Rustam Khan d. 1658. Credit Chester Beatty Library Dublin 07B.35a. Mughal Muraqqa or album now in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin Wright and Stronge 2008 38485 cat. 61. In Europe clarity freedom from internal marks was equally important. In letters to his brother Nathaniel in India John Cholmley time and time again exhorts him to invest in the largest rough Dyamonds you can procure of Christaleene Water and as cleere o f oules as may be possible lett what you send us bee of the very best though you pay the deere them. Flawed and veined stones were less valuable and di icult to cut and they were best avoided. John Fryer pointed this out Care is to be taken likewise in Choices of Rough Diamonds to avoid those that have veins for they will never cut well Fryer 1698 213. Henry Steel added But if you be not careful the Indians will throw one of these stones into a parcel and oftentimes the Value and Assessment of Diamonds  219largest Steel 1779 95. According to Arakel of Tabriz the Europeans in Aleppo Syria said that diamond is not worth anything without polishing it for there are impurities in it that cannot be seen prior to polishing Bournoutian 2006 459. On the other hand Tavernier noted that in India they would hide f laws under facet junctions in cut stones a trick for which modern diamond graders are taught to be aware. Gerard Malynes also mentions the higher value of diamonds without spots or sands burbles awes and vaines Malynes 1622 75. When Jahangir Mughal emperor from 1605 until 1627 had doubts as to the relative quality of two diamonds that his own jewelers were unable to resolve he asked the advice of the defeated Kokra ruler Durjan Sal an expert on diamonds. Durjan Sal pointed out a f law in one of the diamonds and proved his point by having the diamonds tied to the horns of ghting rams. After the ght the awed diamond had broken and the other remained intact Blochmann 1871 11129. It wasnt always easy to predetermine the color or clarity the diamond would have once it was cut. As Gerard Malynes had explained the color or water was only properly discerned after cutting Malynes 1622 75. Charles V of France had received from his father John II thus prior to the latters death in 1364 a large diamond that was described as square but not very f ine and not of good water  nest pas de bonne eaue  Laborde 1851a 83. This is a very early European use of this term water to describe the color of a diamond although it was an old Indian expression even then. Fancy Colors From ancient India to modern Fifth Avenue the epitome of a high quality diamond is the colorless. As Gerard Malynes said The best waters are whitiesh inclining to blew which maketh 220  Value and Assessment of Diamondsthe best illustration and play as some call it . . . but the fassets must be industriously wrought Malynes 1622 75. The illustration and play was presumably the dispersion or color f lashes that had been admired in India two millennia earlier. Hannibal Gammon said more briey in 1606 that the colour of the Diamond is properlie of noe colour Gammon 1606 65v. However color preferences could vary with place. Thus Malynes tells us Diamonds of yellow water which give luster extraordinary by candle light are more in r equest in Germany and some places in Italy where the brown diamonds are also desired. But in England and France they are worth 13 part less Malynes 1622 76. Indian color preference had been noted far earlier by al Brn who said One should blow his bre ath over the diamond until it gets warmed then place in a basin of saline water in which silver has been washed. If it appears white it is of the f iner kind. It is then used for the adornment of swords necklaces and all other jewelry that is used to adorn the upper part of the body. If it appears red it should be suitable for the jewelry worn in the middle of the body. If exhibiting yellow color it is suitable for use in bracelets rings armlets etc. The black kind is suitable for ornaments of the feet. The people of India also say If worn contrariwise to this arrangement and if these colors are employed for the adornment of other instruments and jewels it will shatter with the impact of lightning Said 1989 76. Attractively colored diamonds often highly valued today were treated with little appreciation until relatively recent times. Today a fancy color diamond with a su iciently attractive hue would be an asset rather than a detraction. The color varieties of diamond are enumerated in early Indian texts and copied by Islamic writers such as Mansur in the thirteenth century who reported seven colors whitetransparent pharaonic olive red green black and re colored Hammer 1818 347. Value and Assessment of Diamonds  221However colors other than white colorless do not seem to have been particularly highly valued in India even if exceptional. The Mughal emperor Jahangir referred to one blue diamond brought to him as looking like a sapphire something he had not previously seen. Nevertheless his jewelers valued it at less than a sixth of the price had it been colorless. A number of other colored diamonds are mentioned in both Eastern and European records one example is a clasp set with a pointed blue diamond noted in an inventory of Charles the Bold in the fteenth century Laborde 1851b 144. In 1698 John Fryer noted the Rough Diamonds that seem greenest prove of a good Water when cut and those that seem white when rough prove often bluish being cut Fryer 1698 213. This was important to understand because says Fryer a diamond that is of a Blue Brown or yellow water is not worth half the price of a perfect Stone of a White Water. Tavernier reported that Mir Jumla a prominent provincial governor under the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb showed him ve small bags of diamonds all lasques that is at Indian cut s tonesand of very dark water and very small. Tavernier explained that there was little market for them because in Europe we do not esteem diamonds if they are not clear and white and we make no account of other kinds of water Ball 1889 1130. Mir Jumla sent his diamond miners back to agricultural labor. Despite this setback Jean de Thvenot reported that Mir Jumla owned Four hundred and eight Pounds of Holland weight of diamondsgetting on for 2500 carats Thvenot 1687 103. Indeed colored diamonds do not seem to have attracted much serious attention in Europe until JeanBaptiste Tavernier brought back from his sixth voyage to the East the large blue diamond that he sold to King Louis XIV of France in 1668 for 220000 livres. His invoice describes the stone as a large blue 222  Value and Assessment of Diamondsdiamond in the form of a heart that is pearshaped cut in the Indian fashion Bapst 1889 403 Ogden 2017. The stone eventually became the Hope Diamond. Half a century after Taverniers sale the arrival of what we now know as the Dresden Green diamond in Britain was widely reported in the press. For example the 25 October 1722 edition of the Whitehall Evening Post said One Mr. Marcus Moses lately arrived here from India and had the Honor to wait upon his majesty on Tuesday last with a large Diamond of the Color of an Emerald perfectly f ine and without the least Defect the like of which tis said was never seen in Europe and with which Curiosity his majesty was highly pleased. The king didnt buy it and in the St. Jamess Evening Post of 23 June 1733 it was reported that Moses had sold the diamond to the Emperor of Germany for 36000. T his may have been premature. The gem was certainly o ered to Frederick Augustus I but most accounts such as that by diamond historian Ian Balfour place the actual sale nearly a decade later to the emperors son Balfour 2009 9497. Later that century the Anglo French surgeo n and author John Obadiah Justamond translating the French of Abb Raynal wrote There are diamonds of all colors and of every shade of the several colors. The diamond hath the red of the ruby the orange of the hyacinth the blue of the sapphire and the green of the emerald. T his last is the most scarce and the dearest when it is of a beautiful color Justamond 1784 3411. T he pendant in gures 8.6 and 11.4 is an interesting example of rose cut diamond jewelry that dates to a time roughly between th e arrivals of the Hope and Dresden diamonds in Europe. This ornament now a brooch but originally probably a necklace pendant is a rare example of a piece of jewelry that contains a deliberately chosen color range of diamonds several strongly colored. A century later the British mineralogist John Value and Assessment of Diamonds  223Figure 11.4. Detail of the colored diamond ornament in f igure 8.6. Credit Courtesy of Benjamin Zucker. Mawe said that when distinctly pink blue or green the value of diamonds is much enhanced and eagerly sought for by connoisseurs Mawe 1813 16. T he Cut Cut was also important in assessing value. This was not simply a matter of what style a diamond was cut in but its proportions and condition. Poorly cut or damaged facet edges or corners would reduce value. For example the early seventeenth century T he Goulden Arte or The Jewel House of Gemes notes what it considered good proportions and advised that a diamond must be without any fault both in Corners and Sydes and every one of the 4 corners must be sharpe and cleane cut Heth 1603 65r. However proportions were not all about aesthetics. The same document notes that a thinly cut diamond when set can appear larger than it is and thus was worth more per carat Heth 1603 65v. Similarly stones that were particularly deeply cut which maketh the wayght not to any prot were valued less Heth 1603 66r. 224  Value and Assessment of DiamondsIn practice diamonds table cut in partic ular were prone to have uneven edges and missing corners. In some cases this was due to damage but frequently this was to minimize weight loss in cutting. As we saw above the uneven edges of the settings surrounding diamonds in many sixteenth and seventeenth century jewels a re not poor workmanshipthey actually follow the irregular contours of the diamond as in gure 7.10. When a diamond did have good edges this could be pointed out. The deed of sale of a diamond to a London jeweler in January 158687 described it as one greate square table diamond full cornered and without fault set in a ring of plain golde CP 1442. Twenty years later Sir Arthu r Gorges o ered to sell the Earl of Salisbury jewelry including a large table diamond very perfect in all its corners Giuseppi and Lockie 1965 141. T he overall assessment of a cut diamond thus covered many aspects. Fryer explained Neither the Thick nor too Thin in Substance is best a Thin Stone which is High and Narrow Table not making a shew answerable to its Weight must be valued at less than that which is well spread hath its corners perfect and a pure white without Spots or Foulness is called a Paragon Stone and in full perfection Fryer 1698 213. An Early Explanation of Diamond Grading T he most comprehensive document relating to the evaluation of a diamond can be found in a handwritten document now in the British Library in London BL Add. 72897 14 105. Titled Enquiries into the Values of Diamonds this was written by Sir William Petty an English economist scientist and philosopher who died in 1687. The manuscript probably dates to around 1682. As common for the period it is presented as a dialogue between two people a young man who has bought a diamond ring and is worried that he may have been cheated Value and Assessment of Diamonds  225and Sir William who explains how diamonds are assessed and valued Ogden 2012. Sir William begins by pointing out that because the young man had bought the diamond already set in a ring it was impossible to accurately judge its weight proportions and color and that the assessment of its clarity what he calls the clouds icicles  points within the stone was also hindered because you couldnt see around the stone only in through the front. During this period diamonds were set with closed backs. T he text goes on to explain in detail how a diamond should be examined prior to setting. The four criteria he denes are essentially the same as the four Cs we use todaycarat weight cut color and clarity he calls them Weight Extent Colour  Clearness. Weighing should be carried out with a pair of scales that will weigh with certainty to less than a quarter of a grain. Extentor what we should describe as size and proportionwas assessed with a special measuring gauge made from a piece of transparent mica or thin horn on which lines forming a square one inch by one inch were inscribed with a sharp point. This square was subdivided by ner lines twenty in each direction creating a twenty by twen ty grid. The diamond was viewed through this and its dimensions noted. To aid the observation it helped to make every fourth division in a line something bigger than the rest for distinction sake. To judge colorwhat was then termed wateryou must have 5 or 6 diamonds to lie constantly by you each of a several water and you must have in the opinion of the best jewelers the proportion of value which the said waters to bear one to another. The same was true for clarityClearness. You must have as many foul diamonds as do contain samples of every sort of fault and a note of such abatements in value as an experienced Jeweler would make for every such fault. Petty adds 226  Value and Assessment of Diamondsyou must also have a pair of excellent spectacles for the older sight and advises use of a good microscope. He preempts in almost every way the approach to diamond grading used by gem laboratories worldwide today. The document goes on to describe pricing and price abatements for di erent colors and clar ities. Pettys approach was comprehensive but not unique. The so called Sloane Lapidar y which dates to about the same time as Pettys text also said that the cut and proportions of a diamond impacted on their value British Library Sloane MS 2539 Harris 2009 155. It goes on to say that table and point cuts were the most admirablea statement surely slightly out of date by the time the text was written and thus perhaps repeated uncritically from an earlier text although the writer was a practicing jeweler and lists jewelry made in 167071. That he also refers to buying diamonds brought from Goa by the Portuguese reinforces the suspicion that sections of earlier texts were copied uncritically. An inventory of the jewelry belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough undated but presumably written before or not much later than the dukes death in 1722 gives detailed descriptions of diamonds noting weight color clarity and sometimes even proportions. Examples include A f ine spread brilliant the bottom very deep drawing upon the blue and a high crowned br illiant good water and perfect cleane Thomson 1839 46970. As Nol Antoine Pluche an eighteenth centur y French priest and natural historian succinctly commented The size clarity shape regularity of cut good polish which occasion the beauty and liveliness of play are regarded with reason as the essential components to constitute the beauty merit and the price of diamonds Pluche 1748 353. This sort of critical assessment must surely imply that magnication as mentioned by Sir William Petty was being Value and Assessment of Diamonds  227Figure 11.5. A diamond cutter inspecting his work with a magnier. Credit After Mawe 1823. used but there is little clear evidence for this. Magnication has been known about for more than two millennia as we saw in Chapter 1 but representations of jewelers or lapidaries employing it are very rare. In Alessandro Feis famous sixteenth century paint ing The Goldsmiths Workshop in the Palazzo Vecchio Florence Italy we see a goldsmith examining a gold ewer through a pair of looking glasseswe know he is a goldsmith not a customer because he holds a small hammer. Apart from that I am aware of little else in a gem context until John Mawe illustrated a diamond cutter examining a diamond with a lens in 1823 gure 11.5. Imitation Diamonds Imitations were a perennial problem. They are commented on in ancient India a Roman example is shown in gure 2.8 and there were laws against them in medieval France. The early earring fragment from India in gure 3.6 contained both diamond crystals and rock crystal. Even royal jewels included fakes there 228  Value and Assessment of Diamondsare imitations in the so called Bohemian or Pa latine Crown in f igure 4.7 jewelry at Edinburgh Castle in 1579 included a ring with a counterfeit diamond and the old jewels taken out of the Tower of London in 1600 included 24 rings of gold set with mean diamonds and counterfeit diamonds Salisbury 1904 CP 822 Thomson 1815 291. A gilded silver ring of thirteenth or fourteenth century da te in the Victoria and Albert Museum London has a square pyramidal bezel that was surely intended to imitate a diamond gure 11.6. The British historian Charles Oman refers to a similar ring in the museum at Tournai Oman 1930 66 cat. 241.2 Prior to the development of synthetic or lab grown diamonds in recent years the counterfeits of the past whether in enameled gold or in glass or some other gem material were usually fairly easy to spot if you knew your subject. Glass rock crystal and white sapphire were the commonest fakes the latter in particular since its hardness made it a plausible fake because it would easily scratch glass and so fool the more gullible. Heating a pale colored sapphire w ould turn it colorless making it a highly e ective diamond simulant. Numerous recipes for this survive Wecker and Read in 1660 quoted no fewer than four taken from earlier writers Wecker and Read 1660. A Jewish gem merchant writing in early fteenth century V enice mentions counterfeit diamonds in yellow sapphire but assures us that an expert in diamonds could readily distinguish them Sirat 1968 107879. It was all about observation and experience. As Figure 11.6. A gilded silver ring with the bezel in the form of a pyramidal diamond Western European thirteenth or fourteenth century.

Value and Assessment of Diamonds  229Archbishop Thomas Cranmer said Tell me I pray you how a man without senses shall judge a true diamond Put out his eyes and is not a white sapphire a diamond and a glass all one in his judgement Cranmer 1580 276. Plinys misinterpreted statement that a diamond was strongly magnetic created a problem when it was taken as a test for a true diamond. Diamond is not magnetic. This was noted in 1660 by Wecker and Read in their Secrets of Stones and Jewels which formed book twelve in their Eighteen Books of the Secrets of Art  Nature. They duly repeat the established wisdom that a magnet will draw a true diamond to it then add But we can nd no such experience in our dayes unless it be so that all Diamonds be false Wecker and Read 1660 232. T he commonest and probably most ancient gemological test was the scratch testa diamond would scratch any other gem but nothing other than diamond could scratch a diamond. T he optical properties of diamond could also be used to determine its genuineness. Thomas Nicols in the mid sixteenth centur y seems to say that observation of the play of color of a diamondits dispersionwas used by the most judicious Jewelers to distinguish true Diamond from those of bastard kinds Nicols 1652 46. However the most sophisticated test is that given by Girolamo Cardano an Italian mathematician physician and astrologer in the chapter on gems in his extensive De svbtilitate Cardano 1560 514. He says he learned this test from his friend the jeweler Hieronymus Guerinus Jerome Guerin. The test is unclear to me but seems to be based on reection as viewed from point D in his diagram gure 11.7 when the point of the stone is placed on a ngernail. A problem today is the treatment of diamonds to improve their appearance. Techniques range from radiation to laser drilling. For the student of diamonds in the past these sophisticated modern treatments are not relevant but simpler processes 230  Value and Assessment of Diamondscould still deceive. Benvenuto Cellini openly talks about placing a blue pigment behind a yellow diamond to give a green appearance but this doesnt seem to have been done with any intent to deceive. However similar use of blue dyes behind yellow diamonds to improve their appearance was a big problem a century ago. Even earlier in 1728 a widely reported news item in England said A certain Gentleman of the faculty of Physick has discovered an Art of bringing any sort of yellow or discolourd Diamonds by a certain Chemical Process to a Clearness as perfect as that of the rst Water without the least Detriment to them in any other Respect. The rst Experiment he made was upon a very yellow foul Diamond that he bought of a Jeweller for 50s. for which the same Jeweller had o ered him 12 guineas see for example Stamford Mercury 22 August 1728. At the end of the day the assessment and pricing of diamonds comes down to honesty and experience.

Figure 11.7. Diagram of an optical test for diamonds as illustrated by Girolamo Cardano in his 1560 De svbtilitate. Value and Assessment of Diamonds  231T hat India was the source of diamonds to the ancient medieval and renaissance worlds is clear from what has been said so far. Now it is time to consider the mines in India in more detail and see how as the centuries unfolded European knowledge of the mines there changed from confused myth to practical rsthand acquaintance. T he Valley of Gems In 1375 Abraham Cresques a Jewish book illuminator from the 12 T he Indian Diamond Mines Mediterranean island of Majorca produced an atlas soon acquired by King Charles V of France for the Royal Library. This extraordinary work now known as the Catalan Atlas is in the Bibliothque Nationale Paris. Among the wealth of illustration and annotation we see in the middle of India two men hacking at an animal carcass gure 12.1. Behind them is a deep cleft in the mountains inhabited by serpents and above ies a bird with meat in its beak. This scene is an early European depiction of the recovery of diamonds based on a story even then a thousand years old. This is the legend of the remote and mysterious Valley of Gems retold over the centuries with protagonists from Alexander the Great to Sinbad the Sailor. In essence meat was thrown into the inaccessible and serpent guard ed valley of diamonds birds picked up the meat with adhering diamonds and the diamonds were recovered from them or their nests. Marco Polo explains two methods. In one the men shout loudly so Detail of gure 12.7. 233Figure 12.1.

Credit Bibliothque nationale de France Dpartement des manuscrits Espagnol 30. 234  Indian Diamond Mines that the eagles are thus frightened away and they then recover the pieces of meat and nd them full of diamonds Yule and Cordier 1993 2361. As an alternative the men could search for diamonds in the eagles droppings or simply kill the eagles and recover the diamonds from their stomachs. T he earliest mention of a valley of gems seems to be that by Epiphanius Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus at the very end of the fourth century AD in his commentary on the twelve stones set in the high priests breastplate described in the Book of Exodus Blake and de Vis 1934 11718. This work has survived or did survive in Greek Latin Syriac Coptic Armenian and Georgian versions although not all include the passage with the Valley of Gems. Epiphanius borrowed from earlier Greek and Roman writers including Pliny but there is no known earlier classical tradition of the Valley of Gems and it is possible that it was some traders or travelers tale that had reached him from the east. Since Epiphanius had lived in what are now Egypt Israel and Turkey such exposure is not improbable. The legend had also reached China no later than a century or so after Epiphanius Laufer 1915 68. Berthold Laufer discussed the Valley of Gems legend in detail and concluded that it originated in the Hellenistic orient and was propagated from this center to China to India to the Arabs and to Persia Laufer 1915 20. Perhaps it is more likely that its origin lay a garbled understanding of some form of rite or sacrice accompanying mining indeed esh o erings to a giant snake near diamond mines were recorded in India in the late eighteenth century by Thomas Motte as we will see later. Unlike some later writers Epiphanius didnt equate any of the twelve gems in the high priests breastplate with diamond. He didnt mention diamond at all but he does explain that the jacinth stone was found in a remote deep valley in Scythia to the north of the Black Sea or east to the Urals not India. To retrieve the stones men threw in lambs carcasses to which the gems adhered. Eagles picked up the meat and carried it to their nests. Epiphanius reported that when the eagles had eaten their f ill and own o  again the men come collect the gems and clean them from the carcass which the eagles have brought up take them away and hand them over to the kings who sent them thither. By medieval times the valley had gained the additional deterrent of venomous snakes and the gems were typically identied as diamonds. In medieval Islamic versions the snakes and diamond recovery were sometimes recounted as separate myths but the hero was now Alexander the Great Ruska 1912 150 Said 1989 8184. Later when there was an attempt to balance appealing old myth with scientic exactitude it was explained that Indian Diamond Mines  235whereas all the ancient diamonds in the world derived from the stones retrieved from the Valley of Gems by Alexander there were now diamonds coming also from new mines in India Bournoutian 2006 457. One of the latest appearances of the story in Europe is at the beginning of the seventeenth century in the Goulden Arte where William Heth places the diamond valley with its venimus beasts a precise fteen days journey beyond the northeast Indian port of Cambay modern Khambhat Heth 1603 62v. T he Location of the Mines Indias fame as provider of diamonds was well entrenched in the medieval mind established by persistent folklore and objective details from Pliny Marco Polo and numerous Muslim writers including the twelfth century Sic ilian based geograph er Muhammed al Idris i who commented that India produced the diamonds with which the gems were engraved Jauber 1836 7172. However disentangling the actual sources known in antiquity is tricky. Early Indian texts such as the Arthasstra the Ratnapariksa of Buddha Bhatta the Brihat Samhita of Varhamihira and th e Garuda Purana all provide lists of diamond sources but seldom can the places they name be identied today. The Arthasstra probably the earliest of these and likely compiled in phases between the later second century BC and the late third or fourth century AD explains that gems were found in mines streams and other places Olivelle 2013 2528. Much the same statement is repeated in the Garuda Purana which as well as showing how much the later text was reliant on the earlier makes it clear that there was deliberate mining from an early period not just fortuitous discoveries in rivers. 236  Indian Diamond MinesFigure 12.2. The main diamond mining ar eas in India. Map Jack Ogden. More recent centuries have seen extensive studies of the locations of the various diamond mines in India. A comprehensive account is A Description of the Diamond Mines wr itten in 1675 probably by the diamond dealer Nathaniel Cholmley and reproduced in full here in the appendix. The nineteenth century was particularly productive with investigations by such people as the Scottish surgeon and natural historian Benjamin Heyne 1814 German geographer Karl Ritter 1836 East Indian Company soldier and orientalist Thomas Newbold 1843 and Irish geologist Valentine Ball 1881a 1881b and 1889 2348359. More recent authors have generally drawn heavily on Ball but the possibility of modern commercial exploitation of Indian diamonds has prompted some new geological studies. As with the ancient Indian texts the identities of the various mines mentioned in even quite recent publications are not always clear today. The spelling of place names has been erratic political borders uid and some regional and other names have changed completely. For simplicitys sake the mines are considered here in three groupings north south and what we might consider the new Golconda mines gure 12.2. Indian Diamond Mines  237Only alluvial diamonds were exploited in India in ancient and historic timesthat is diamonds washed down from original primary deposits to remain in riverbeds or what had originally been riverbeds. As we saw above early Indian texts refer to diamonds found in pits and streams and Marco Polo added a more practical alternative to using eagles to bypass serpents in the diamond valley when he noted that plenty of diamonds were found in rivers Yule and Cordier 1993 2360. The painting in gure 12.3 is taken from Le livre des voyages de Marco Polo as translated by Robert Frescher 1475 1525 and now in the Bibliothque Nationale de France. In addition to some ferocious serpents and rather docile eagles we see on the right a naked man in a river. This presumably alludes to Polos mention of diamonds in rivers and if so is perhaps the earliest representation of alluvial diamond mining. T he Northern Group of Mines T he northern diamond mining areas included what Jean Baptiste Tav ernier described as the most ancient of all and were a major source for the early Mughal court. In the sixteenth century Garcia de Orta a Portuguese doctor practicing in Goa noted that there were diamond mines in the Deccan near the territory of Imadixa whom we call Madremaluco Markham 1913 345. These de Orta says were traded in Lispor modern Achalpur. Buyers included Gujaratis who then sold them in the city of Vijayanagar modern Hampi far to the south. Madremaluco was presumably Fath ullah Imad ul Mulk and Imadixa th e Imad shahi dynasty of Berar that Imad ul Mulk founded with Achalpur as its capital. This ruler had died in 1504 some sixty years before de Orta published his work so he apparently relied on older accounts. These diamond mines may well have been those some two hundred miles east of Achalpur 238  Indian Diamond Minesat Vairagad on the Triveni River. Valentine Ball equated these with the diamond mine at Biragarh mentioned in the late sixteenth century Ain i Akbari which deals with the administration of the Mughal emperor Akbars empire Ball 1881a 3739 Ball 1889 235 Jarrett 1891 230. These are presumably also the diamond mines at Barakar that Akbars successor Jahangir ruled 1605 to 1627 planned to seize but which were surrendered without a ght since opposition to the victorious army was unrealistic Rogers and Beveridge 2003 221 22. In his memoirs the Tzuk i Jahngr the emperor Jahangir observed that these diamonds are superior in kind and beauty to all other kinds of diamonds and much esteemed by jewelers. They are of good shape and larger and superior. Vairagad may also be the Vairagara source of diamonds listed in the Sanskrit Navaratnapariksa and some other early Indian texts thus attesting to the antiquity of these mines Finot 1896 xxv 148. Figure 12.3. Diamond mining in India showing the valley of eagles and snakes and also alluvial mining at right. Credit From Le livre des voyages de Marco Polo 14751525. Bibliothque nationale de France Ms 5219 rser ve 141r. Indian Diamond Mines  239T hey may also be the diamond mines that the Persian historian Fereshta reports that Ahmad Shah I Wali 142236 ruler of the kingdom of Bidar possessed himself of in 1425 since during that military campaign he spent a year at Achalpur the old trading hub for the Vairagad diamonds Scott 1794 103. Ball suggested that the Albenigaras diamond mines mentioned by the f ifteenth century Italian t raveler Niccol de Conti might represent Vairagad old Biragarh with the added Arabic prex Al Ball 1881b 134. As noted below however an equation with Bisnaga one of the many old variant spellings of Vijayanagar on the same basis is not impossible. T he Mughal emperor Jahangir described how diamonds were retrieved from a river in the province of Khokhara Khokhra an early name for what is now Jharkhand the East Indian state that includes the diamond mines on the river Koel some 160 miles southeast of Patna. Here says Jahangir among the stones and sand they found diamonds of all sizes including the occasional large diamond worth 100000 rupees Ball 1881a 2526 Rogers and Beveridge 2003 1315. In 1616 on Jahangirs instructions Ibrahim Khan conquered the region seized these mines where the locals carry on work in the bed of the stream and bring to Court whatever diamonds are found Rogers and Beveridge 2003 1316. The emperor recorded that one had been received with a value of 50000 rupees and added that he hoped for many more to ll his jewel house. The mines in this area may equate with Kalinga a source of diamonds mentioned in some early Sanskrit texts Finot 1896 xxvixxvii. In 1766 Thomas Motte superintendent of the police in Kolkata formerly Calcutta visited Sambalpur on the upper Mahanadi River where he says diamonds were found in sands of one of its tributaries the river Ib Motte 1800. This was at the request of Lord Clive who was keen to use diamonds as a way to send money to England. Motte noted The mountains abound 240  Indian Diamond Mineswith gold and diamonds but the natives are deterred from working the mines by their indolence and fear of the Mahrattas to whom their riches would only point them out as more desirable prey. For similar reasons the locals only searched riverbeds rather than looking for the source in the mountains. While in the area Thomas Motte visited what he described as the Naik Buns  Nagbansi  the great snake worshipped by the mountainous Rajahs. This huge snake from its track in the river mud Motte estimated its diameter at upwards of two feetlived in a cavern and was given o erings of goat and fowl. If as likely this was an extremely ancient practice we may have an explanation for the origin of the legend of the snakes in the Valley of Gems. Tavernier said diamonds from Soumelpur were all the beautiful points . . . but a large stone is rarely found there Ball 1889 26267. He added that stones from this area had not been seen in Europe for a long time because of the wars in the region. It is tempting to equate this Soumelpur as visited by Tavernier with the Sambalpur as visited by Thomas Motte. However Ball has explained in detail why he preferred to identify Taverniers Soumelpur with a mine at Sumelpur or Soumelpor shown on older maps on the river Koel Ball 1881a 2829 Ball 1889 26263n 35459. The distances Tavernier gives would indeed suggest that mines on the Koel were meant. Ball also proposed that the mine at Sumelpur equated with Sambalaka which the ancient geographer Ptolemy said produced the worlds nest diamonds.1 In his 1675 account of the diamond mines the author probably Nathaniel Cholmley mentions mines in the hills in and near Bengala Bengal. He explains that this barren toilsome and craggy country to use his words was left alone by the Moors but the locals worked a few mines privately. This wording is reminiscent of Thomas Mottes and may similarly have Indian Diamond Mines  241meant the diamond gravels of the upper Mahanadi River. However the Ain i Akbari also mentions in Bengal a place called Harpah in Madaran which there is a diamond mine producing chiey very small stones Jarrett 1891 125. This locality is uncertain but one possibility is that Madaran was in the district of Hooghly just north of Kolkata in Bengal Blochmann 1870. In the early part of the seventeenth century Joannes de Laet director of the Dutch West India Company said that to the south of the Ganges was the territory of Rahja Mugg ImadulMulk who is also said to possess a very rich diamond mine Hoyland 1928 60. This could relate to one or more of the areas already mentioned. Early Indian texts also refer to Paundra as an ancient source of diamonds that Louis Finot an archaeologist and director of the cole Franaise dExtrme Orient identied with Pundradeca which encompassed the important and very early trading port of Tamralipta believed to be modern Tamluk some thirty miles southwest of Kolkata. This may have been a trading center rather than a mining area Finot 1896 xxvi. T he late sixteenth century Ain i Akbari also says that the peasants nd small diamonds some fteen miles from the ancient fort at Kalinjar Jarrett 1891 159. These are the mines in the region of Panna. Ball re cords numerous mines in this region and says the earliest European to visit these was the Jesuit missionary Joseph Tie enthaler in 1765 Ball 1889 2351. Apart from the Ain i Akbari mention little is known of the early history of these mines but there was still diamond mining at Panna in the nineteenth century. A drawing made in 1867 gure 12.4 shows the dire conditions of the workers naked and up to their knees in water in a deep pit practices may have changed little over the preceding centuries. This drawing may be based on an early photograph of a diamond mine.2 242  Indian Diamond MinesT he Southern Group T he southern mines can be thought of as a group roughly bounded by Bellary Kurnool and Kadapa thus along the banks of the Penna River and then northwest up to the Tungabhadra River and Raichur. Near the village of Jonnagiri forty four miles east of Bellary there are rock carved edic ts of the emperor Ashoka of circa 250 BC. According to the Indian gemFigure 12.4. Diamond mines at Panna in the later nineteenth century by Jules Henri Jean Schaumburg. After Ball 1881a. Indian Diamond Mines  243ologists Jayshree Panjikar and K. T. Ramchandran these refer to the gold and diamond mines in the area and although I have not been able to conrm this from the archaeological literature their presence here would suggest early exploitation  Panjikar and Ramchandran 2005. Going forward a millennium and a half at the village of Anumpalle some twenty miles to the southwest of Jonnagiri there is a stele dated to 1336 that also mentions diamond mining Panjikar and Ramchandran 2005. T hese diamonds were washed locally and then taken to the capital what is now Hampi just under a hundred miles away to the east. Early texts from the Ratnapariksa onward give Matanga as one of the eight main sources of diamond and this was possibly in this region Finot 1896 xxvxxvi. T he southern mines came variously within the kingdoms of Vijayanagar Bijapur and Golconda depending on date it was a time of war and borders changed. For example as Valentine Ball pointed out the diamond mines around Kurnool came within the Vijayanagar empire until 1564 when they passed to the Kutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda Ball 1889 2352. Then in 1687 the area came into Mughal control when the emperor Aurangzeb conquered the Deccan. Thus when in the mid fteenth century diamond mines were visited by the Venetian merchant Niccol de Conti he describes them in terms of their distance from Hampi capital of the Vijayanagar empire Major 1857 2930. The mines were he said some fteen days journey north of Hampi on a mountain called Albenigaras. Here were venomous creatures and serpents and thus men threw meat into the area that was picked up by eagles and vultures along with the adhering diamondsyet another retelling of the Valley of Gems legend but here associated with a specic mine. As noted above the name Albenigaras may represent the Arabic article al added either to Vairagad old Biragarh or to Bisnaga one of the many old variant spellings of Vijayanagar. In 244  Indian Diamond Mineseither case it might reect Arab involvement in the diamond mining or trading there. Several other Europeans mention diamond mines in the Bijapur modern Vijayapura kingdom. The Portuguese traveler and horse trader Ferno Nuniz in the 1530s mentions Gate as a place for supplying diamonds to the Hampi markets probably modern Gooty fty miles east of Bellary Sewell 1900 388n7. T he Goa based Portugues e doctor Garcia de Orta said In Bisnaguer they diamonds are in two or three rocks which yield much to the King of Bisnaguer Markham 1913 345. Another comment was by the Dutch merchant Jan Huyghen van Linschoten who spent several years in India in the 1580s. He reported that any large diamonds found in these mines belonged to the king and that concealment was a capital oense Burnell and Tiele 1885 2137. In 1675 the mines near Kunool were among those described as being in the kingdom of Bijapur. The writer probably Cholmley describes fteen such mines. One was Ramulconetathat is Rammalakota also known in the past as Raolconda less than twenty miles from south Kurnool. The detail of the ca. 1744 map in gure 12.5 shows Raolconda with the note that there were diamond mines in the area. Valentine Ball tried in vain to identify the location of the other fourteen of Cholmleys Bijapur mines but admitted defeat saying I would venture to commend the identication of those mines which are unplaced in the above list to someone with local knowledge. The mines around Rammalakota were described in some detail by Tavernier and described and mapped by Ball Ball 1881a 1316 and map 1. Tavernier describes conditions at the mines diamond cutting there and foreign merchants visiting to buy diamonds and notes that these mines were found two hundred years before his timea comment Ball says may need to be taken with a pinch of salt Ball 1889 243. Ball suggests that a diamond mine described by the Venetian merchant Caesar Fredericke in the 1560s was also Rammalakota Ball 1889 276n. The distances given to the Rammalakota mine by Tavernier seem to be underestimated he says the Rammalakota mine was ve days journey from Golconda and eight or nine from Bijapur. The actual distances are about 160 and 230 miles by road respectively. On the other hand Frederickes statement that it was a journey of six da ys from Hampi to the mines a distance of about 130 miles seems a bit brief assuming travel by ox cart where one would expect an average of twelve to fteen miles a day. Fredericke says that he was told that the mine was a great place compassed with a wall and that they sell the earth within the wall for so much a squadron and the limits are set how deepe or how low they shall digge. He also says that any larger stones were reserved for the king but not much was being mined because of the troubles that have beene in that kingdome Hakluyt 1599 348. T he East India Company records from the 1620s noted that near Bijapur there was an old diamond mine that provided some diamonds and that these were bought by the Portuguese although with little prot Sainsbury 1884 446. Nathaniel Cholmley knowingly remarked that while these mines are known to yield Stones as large and good as those of Galconda the king kept the best and so while Golconda is famous for the largeness of those diamonds i t aords Viliapore Bijapur is noted for the smallest. But not all mines yielded good stones for the king. As noted above in September 1652 at Gandikota on the Pennar River Mir Jumla an important provincial governor under the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb showed Tavernier f ive small bags of poor quality diamonds. When Tavernier said there was no market for such diamonds in Europe Mir Jumla explained that when he rst contemplated the conquest of the region he was told of the diamond mines and sent 1200 men to 246  Indian Diamond Mineswork them. However the ve bags represented the total yield for the year and so he stopped mining and sent all those poor people back to tillage Ball 1889 1230. Mir Jumla was something of a diamond expert. Tavernier described how he showed him some gems hoping to sell them to him and Mir Jumla examined them well Ball 1889 1229. T he Golconda Mines T he mines along the lower Krishna River are those usually thought of today as the Golconda mines even though the Golconda Sultanate ca. 15181687 extended further to the south encompassing some older mines along the Penna River Ball 1881a 1624 and map 2. The term Golconda also applied Figure 12.5. Detail of A Map of India on the West Side of the Ganges Comprehending the Coasts of Malabar Cormandel and the Island Ceylon by Emanuel Bowen ca. 1744.

Here the Krishna River is labeled R. de Coulour and just above is the label Diamond Mines of Coulour. This was Kollur the most famous mine here Cholmleys Qoulure which seems to have been rst discovered around 1619. Nathaniel Cholmley described it as the rst Mine made use of in this Kingdom. In the early 1620s William Methwold an English merchant and East India Company administrator visited and described a diamond mine that he says had recently been discovered in the kingdom of Golconda Moreland 1931 3033. He notes it was four days journey from Machilipatnam not far from the Krishna River. This was almost certainly the Kollur mine Ball 1889 256n. Four days is a fair estimate of travel time by the usual ox cart. Andries Soury with the Dutch East India Company Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie VOC at Machilipatnam who accompanied Methwold to the mine wrote to the directors at Amsterdam in January 1621 saying that some fteen to eighteen months earlier a diamond mine had been discovered at a place about forty eight to fty miles from Machilipatnam V OC 1073 fols. 15659. 3 An East India Company document dated January 1624 says that the mine had been found four years earlier Foster 1909 211. William Methwold described how after this mines discovery Jewelers of all the neighboring nations resorted to the place and that there were no fewer than 30000 souls working there. So crowded was the area that the best lodgings he and his companions could nd near the mines was a handsome hogstie. Soury says it was a very large mine with extensive workings employing almost 20000 men VOC 1073 fols. 15659. Soury also tells us that the mine had been leased out by the king but that all diamonds found there weighing more than eight carats had to be given to him. This meant that few diamonds over seven carats were brought to the market at Machilipatnam. Methwold described the working of the mine in some detail These mynes are not as with us in Europe carried under ground and supported with timber but digged right downe in square large pits. Whether it be that all the earth a ords more or lesse prot whereas ours onely run in veines or whether they want props or judgement to take this course I cannot determine but am sure that in freeing of the water and bringing up the earth they goe the furthest way to worke for in place of pullies and such like devices they with many people setting sitting one above another hand up from one to another untill it comes to the place it must rest in and from hence proceedeth the use of so many people seeing that besides the earth the where over night they wrought dry is next place mor ning a fathome deepe under water Moreland 1931 32.

Methwold further explains that the Kollur mine at the foot of a great mountain not far from the Krishna River had been a barren inhospitable place but after the lucky discovery of diamonds there was peopled with a hundred thousand souls consisting of myners merchants and such others as live by following such concourses Moreland 1931 33.

This representation is perhaps based on Methwolds or de Laets account of Kollur. This is not the earliest depiction of Indian diamond mines. In the 1570s the artist Tommaso Manzuoli decorated the walls and ceiling of the study of Francesco I de Medici in the Palazzo Vecchio Florence. The representations included a diamond mine. This fanciful depiction has naked miners with their left arms tied behind their backs searching the ground and shallow pits and similarly naked but unfettered colleagues suspended by ropes on precipitous rocky crags. Perhaps surprisingly there are no serpents or eagles and thus identifying this imaginative scene with diamond mining may seem far fetched but it w as so identied in the artists lifetime Borghini 1584 540. T he discovery of the Kollur mine h ad two eects. A letter dated November 1621 announced Diamonds are much fallen in price by reason of the myne lately found Foster 1906 327. Also the Mughal emperor Jahangirs ears had pricked up at news of the mine and sent an ambassador Abdul Aziz to Golconda to claim the income from it Foster 1906 332 208n. His visit was preempted. In August 1621 Methwold and others wrote The diamond mine is shut up Foster 1906 26466.

T he gold rush and general excitement surrounding the discovery of the Kollur mine in around 1619 and the impact its opening and then closing had on prices support Nathaniel 252  Indian Diamond MinesCholmleys statement that it was the rst mine opened in the region. The othersCholmley lists twenty three in tota lwere presumably opened after 1620 since he notes that they were now employed or have been so lately. Dutch East India Company correspondence dated January 1621 says a mine had been discovered at Bamimganne Pully some three days journey from Machilipatnam VOC 1072 fols. 17580v. A 1623 letter from Machilipatnam back to Holland noted that a peasant had found two large diamonds while digging behind his house while a letter of November 1640 mentions Pallam where the dyamond myne is although this Pallam has been not identif ied VOC 1078 fols. 390 93v Foster 1912 264. In Cholmleys day the most recently opened mine was at Melwillee which he calls the New Mine rst worked in 1670. The absence of diamond mining in the Krishna area before about 1619 is also indicated by two Dutch accounts of Golconda written during the previous decade one by Antony Schorrer the other probably by Pieter van Ravesteyn. Neither makes any mention of diamond mines in the region Moreland 1931. Tavernier recites the story of the discovery of the rst diamond at Kollur by a poor man digging the land to plant millet in the mid to later sixteenth century but perhaps not undue weight should be attached to this date or account Ball 1889 257. Methwold attributes the discovery to a silly goatherd Moreland 1931 30 and in the 1790s Benjamin Heyne visited seven of the mining areas and said that the mines at Kodavatikall on the banks of the Krishna Cholmleys Codawillicul were discovered when it was noticed that a shepherd was lighting his tobacco with sparks struck from diamonds he had picked up Heyne 1814 92107. The poor man was killed to ensure his silence after he had pointed out the source of the stones and subsequently a bullock load of diamonds was said to have been found there. We will encounter such stories again when Indian Diamond Mines  253we come to the discovery of diamonds in Brazil and might well imagine the universality of such tales lies in some deep seated human need to le aven the greed of exploration and exploitation with a mythical birth in innocence. T here are few references to the diamond mines or indeed the diamond trade in East India Company documents through the 1630s and 1640s other than the odd allegation of private trading and embezzlement. The wars in the region during the 1630s hindered trade Foster 1910 184. By the late 1630s however Golconda was a tributary to the Mogul empire and it was now possible again for Europeans to travel to the diamond mines to buy. Initially the Dutch were in favor but things begin to change for the English in the early 1650s. Walter Littleton with the East India Company at Fort St. George and the broker Venkata Brahman visited Mir Jumla who ruled Golconda Foster 1915 1213. Although formerly well disposed to the Dutch Mir Jumla had perceived abundance of pride and indelitie in them so he now bore a reall a ection to the English and wished to do business with them. Parcels of diamonds began to be sent to London in increasing numbers so much so that in 1659 we hear of a glut of diamonds in England Foster 1915 147 Foster 1921 20. As a result of this trade London became a major center for diamond cutting. Cholmley noted that although the Golconda mines produced the largest stones miners there could dig away a considerable estate and nd nothing. In contrast those mining at Vijayapura though seldom realizing a fortune could nd many small stones and generally covered their costs and most made some money. Other Europeans that visited mines in this area in the seventeenth century included the Bruges born diamo nd merchant Jacques de Coutre Sir Streynsham Master an East India Company agent at Fort St. George and the Dutch doctor Pieter de Lange Hofmeester 2012 Temple 1911 217275 van 254  Indian Diamond MinesDam 1932 17681 Gommans et al. 2001 313 322. Most tantalizing are three Manifests in the British Library dated 1731. T hese are signed by Indian merchants who attest that a Mrs. Margaret Moses with whom they were well acquainted had seen all of the diamond mines in this country and Not any Gentile Merchant having been to so many Mines BL Sloane 1968 fol. 54. Sadly I have been able to nd little else about this woman or her visit. Security of course was a perennial problem with a constant battle of wits between those overseeing the mine workings and those hoping to purloin a gem or two. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century William Heth reports how overseers searched the Indian miners so near that they leave no so much as their privies partes unsearched Heth 1603 63r. Over succeeding centuries when the Indian mines were all but forgotten and Brazil and then South Africa provided the majority of the worlds diamonds similar problems and attempts at smuggling arose. Charles Boxer has described the subterfuges and security measures at the Brazilian diamond mines in the eighteenth century showing that human nature and ingenuity are perennial Boxer 1962 20425. India had been famous for its diamonds since classical times thus encouraging over the centuries traders from the Armenian Persian and Islamic worlds then Europeans via the hazardous overland routes and nally with the opening up of the direct sea route around 1500 the European trading companies. T he mysterious Valley of Gems of legends gave way to the increasingly accurate descriptions of traders and travelers culminating in the comprehensive account on the mines probably written by Nathaniel Cholmley in 1675 which form the appendix to this volume and his explanations of the day to day pract icalities of the trade which we will look at in the next chapter. Indian Diamond Mines  255T he earliest depiction we have of a European diamond merchant in India is probably the frontispiece of the 1678 Amsterdam edition of Jean Baptiste Ta verniers Travels gure 13.1. Here Tavernier and other well dressed Eu ropeans are shown being o ered diamonds by the near  nake d natives. Behind them is the mine with miners at work a hoist above. This Eurocentric bias makes it easy to forget that diamonds had already been traded 13 T he Diamond Trade in India from India for some two thousand years and that there were well established and sophisticated trading networks in place although few tangible records of these survive. The majority of gem traders within India were Indians themselves and of course Arab Jewish and Armenian traders had long been at the diamond mines and trading centers in India by the time Europeans gained a foothold toward the end of the medieval period. Indians mainly Guajaratis traded within India seemingly less so outside until later although Tijl Vanneste has recently noted with regard to the diamond trade that in general the historical role of Indian trade networks in serving Asian markets remains undervalued Vanneste 2011. In the late eighteenth century the navigator Thomas Forrest mentioned merchants of Golconda perhaps Indians selling diamonds to the Chinese in the Philippinesalong with Sri Lankan traders selling sapphires and rubies Forrest 1780 320. Although Indians had built up a sophisticated trading netDetail of gure 13.4. 257Figure 13.1. The frontispiece of the 1678 Amsterdam edition of Taverniers Travels showing him bein g oered diamonds by the Indians a diamond mine behind.work through Iran parts of central Asia and Russia by the early seventeenth century diamonds do not seem to have been a part of this. The English traveler Anthony Jenkinson who reached Bukhara in what is now Uzbekistan in 1557 found Indian merchants there but reports that they had brought no precious stones Dale 2002 24. However some Indian diamonds were reaching Moscow in the 1670s by way of the Dutch and Armenians Romaniello 2012 111. Ruy Gonzlez de Clavijo in Samarkand in 140305 as the ambassador of Henry III of Castile at the court of Timur Tamerlane the founder of the Timurid empire in Persia and central Asia says that diamonds reached Samarkand from China a reminder that Marco Polos diamonds were supposedly obtained by him in China Markham 1859 171.1 T he part played by Jewish traders in the Indian diamond market prior to the seventeenth century is unclear. The Greek geographer Strabo in the rst century BC had commented that it was hard to nd a place in the world where Jews were not to be found. Ibn Kurradadhbeh an early ninth century Arab geographer described Jewish merchants traveling from North Africa to India and even China and others say much the same see for example Gl 2004 passim. Diamonds are not specically mentioned among goods they traded but pearls are. Ceylon is described as having had a large Jewish community by the tenth century and this must have been for the trade in gems and pearls. Once into more recent times the Jews played a signicant role in the diamond trade. The part played by Jews in the London trade has been mentioned but there is also remarkable correspondence concerning the diamond trade between London Jews and Indians in Goa Trivellato 2009. Jacques or James de Paiva of Portuguese descent moved from Amsterdam to LonDiamond Trade in India  259don and then in 1685 became one of the rst Jewish merchants and diamond traders with permission to reside and trade in Madras in India then known as Fort St. George. This move met with some concern. A letter from John Cholmley in England written in December 1685 notes that Paive de Paiva had made an interest with Child Sir Joshua Child of the East India Company and is now going out to Fort St. George to buy diamonds for the Company which will certainly ruin the trade as to us and carry it wholly to the jewes. De Paiva died just two years later in 1687 at Golconda but not before his wife had become the mistress of the man who that same year became the governor of MadrasElihu Yale the founder of Yale University. This was just part of the scandal surrounding Yale. John Nicks went to India with the East India Company in 1668 and married Catherine Barker in 1680. He spent much time away from Fort St. George and Mrs Nicks then lived with Mr Yale at his garden house which she and Mrs Paiva have and do frequent to the scandal of Christianity among the heathens Cotton 1905 11. Armenian traders had been present in India since antiquity and were trading diamonds and other Indian goods to the west via their entrept Aleppo. They had trading privileges in Venice Livorno and other Italian cities by the 1500s about the time the Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orta mentioned the many Armenians in India although he doesnt mention them specically in the context of the diamond trade Markham 1913 351. The size of the Armenian diamond business in the 1500s is unknown but Evelyn Korsch has noted that in around 1600 86 percent of the European demand for raw silk was being met by Armenian merchants Korsch 2014. Certainly by the mid 1650s the Armen ians were purchasing such a large quantity of diamonds in India that prices had escalated by 40 percent Vanneste 2011. The arrival of the English and Dutch trading com260  Diamond Trade in Indiapanies by no means displaced the Armenians or Jews from this business. As Korsch also notes the European trading companies traded in kind not cash leaving the diamond trade from India largely open to private traders which in practice meant predominantly Armenians and Sephardic Jews Korsch 2014. In his recent study of Armenian trading networks Sebouh Aslanian has quoted an account roll in Venice dated 1673 whereby an Armenian agent Agha di Matus of Tabriz was given a consignment of diamonds of di erent grades in Sura t and then traveled through New Julfa the Armenian trading center in Iran then Turkey and Europe to Venice and ultimately Livorno to sell them Aslanian 2011 74. The Armenian scholar Mesrovb Jacob Seth has noted various instances concerning Armenian diamond dealings in Surat including a 1669 dispute relating to the joint purchase by two Armenians of a large diamond weighing about 140 carats Seth 1937 25961. They wanted a fellow Armenian to arbitrate since they feared they would lose the stone if the governor of Surat heard of it. The Armenians were competitors of the Dutch and English trading companies but could also work with them Ivinson 2014. In 1688 the directors of the East India Company agreed to extend benets to Armenian merchants who by trading their goods via London would benet England. One of the best known Ar menian diamond merchants were the Shahrimanians or Scerimans of New Julfa recently studied in depth by Evelyn Korsch 2014. They were active in Europe particularly Italy by the mid seventeen th century and were mainly involved in the diamond and colored gem business. As Korsch has noted their commercial activities were operated on a clan basis and they were able to create a worldwide trading network that facilitated import and export transactions between Europe and Asia. They utilized both the traditional land routes and the sea route between Goa and Lisbon. It was Diamond Trade in India  261an extensive network they had business branches in Venice Livorno Rome Amsterdam Cadiz Paris Vienna Moscow Constantinople Basra Bagdad Madras and Myanmar. Their diamond business declined with the discovery of diamonds in Brazil in the 1720s. Of the Europeans Italian traders seem to have been rst to arrive in India most famous being Marco Polo at the close of the 1300s although he can hardly be classed as typical since he stayed in the east for the best part of a quarter century. When the Portuguese Vasco da Gama rst stepped onto Indian soil in May 1498 after completing the earliest direct sea journey there from Europe he was supposedly greeted by two Arabs speaking in the Genoese Italian dialect. The Portuguese colony in Goa was established in 1510 and over the subsequent decades became the primary hub for their diamond trade as we will see. This market remained important well into the seventeenth century. Huybert Vissnich with the Dutch Trading Company at Masulipatam wrote to his directors in Amsterdam in 1621 explaining that too little capital was being invested in diamonds by the Dutch and English and that most diamonds were being sent to Goa Ormuz Aleppo and Persia and Turkey VOC 1074 fols. 292293 v 23. Details of the day to day European diamo nd trade in India in the second half of the seventeenth century can be gleaned from various sources including Jean Bapt iste Taverniers account of his travels to India and the business he did there. Tavernier shown in Eastern dress in his portrait by Nicolas de Largillire gure 13.2 made a total of six trips to India traveling overland where he bought and sold jewels culminating in his selling to Louis XIV of France a group of diamonds that included the blue stone that became known as the French Blue and later the Hope Diamond Ball 1889 passim Ogden 2017. Tavernier was not the only gem dealer to sell diamonds to 262  Diamond Trade in IndiaFigure 13.2. Portrait of Jean Baptiste Ta vernier by Nicolas de Largillire ca. 1680. Credit Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum B raunschweig inv. 520.Louis XIV. Another was the Amsterdam jeweler David Bazu mentioned above. In the 1660s Bazu sold Louis several diamonds including one particularly large diamond which was probably that reputedly purchased by him in India for the then equivalent of 100000 an extraordinarily high sum in those days Ogden 2017. He nanced this by borrowing at 46 percent interest half this amount from Armenians some of whom accompanied him on his journey home as far as Smyrna modern Izmir in Turkey to receive their money. Bazu was traveling back to Europe in the same large silk caravan as Tavernier then on his sixth and nal trip. A letter from Benjamin Lannoy who was British consul in Aleppo to Sir Heneage Finch then Charles IIs ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople modern Istanbul reports that on this return trip Tavernier had bought a large diamond for 7000 from an Arab in Isfahan perhaps the large blue diamond that later became the French Blue and ultimately the Hope. Taverniers sixth trip also resulted in a legal case he brought against the heirs of jeweler Daniel Chardin who had also sold diamonds to Louis XIV. The details are recorded in a Factum of which several copies survive Ogden 2017. Tavernier had taken goods of Chardins to sell in Persia and India and was seeking repayment for costs he had incurred dealing with Ottoman customs.2 Information about the English trade in diamonds in India is of course provided by the detailed East India Company records. The East India Company was an English company formed to trade with the East Indies that received its charter at the end of 1600. This was the rst of such European trading companies to be formed. The Dutch East India Company the VOC chartered in 1602 has also left copious records. Less formal but particularly useful for the practical details of trade is the largely unpublished correspondence between the Cholmley 264  Diamond Trade in Indiabrothers Nathaniel and John. Nathaniel Cholmley arrived in India around 1665 and in 1667 was granted permission to tra  ique in diamonds. He was the East India Companys accredited agent at Golconda for purchasing gems between 1674 and mid 1679 Temple 1911 2128n4. F or several years Nathaniel Cholmley in India supplied diamonds to his brother John in London. During the 1660s the East India Company did not restrict the private trade in diamonds Foster 1923 188. Diamonds could be sent back to England with small charges for transport and customs and at the senders risk Foster 1923 196 Sainsbury and Foster 1925 16 18 66. Nevertheless it was not an easy business unless like Nathaniel Cholmley you really knew the trade well. East India Company employees had low salaries and when they sought to make money with diamonds were liable to be cheated 50 per cent and they never the wiser Foster 1923 18384. In 1668 the East India Company agreed that Nathaniel Cholmley could reside at Golconda where he could trade in diamonds and jewels and also travel from place to place but he should not engage in any other trade nor do anything prejudicial to the company. He also had to give an account to the company of the diamonds he sent to England Foster 1927 131 Sainsbury and Foster 1925 423. He seems to have abused this agreement within the year Foster 1927 277. Perhaps not surprisingly the company introduced restrictions on private trade in diamonds in 1670 and took the entire trade into their hands in 1671 Fawcett 1954 273 Foster 1955 46. But they never stamped out private trade and even the governor of Fort St. George did little to improve things. In 1679 the company had suspected Nathaniel Cholmley of illegal diamond dealing and the then gover nor Streynsham Master was asked to make the necessary enquiries. Master simply called all the factors Diamond Trade in India  265together and asked if anyone knew of any fraudsthey all said no. Nathaniel Cholmleys last visit to the mines was in November 1681 and he left India in 1682 a rich man. T he letter that sheds most light on the practicalities of business in India in the Cholmley correspondence is one written by Nathaniel to his good and trusty Friends Robert Freeman and Richard Browne in 1682 when he left India advising them on all aspects as to how they might best trade in diamonds there Cholmley 166493 fols. 005051 et passim. T he rst thing was to procure an honest Servant to serve you. Cholmley recommended Vogjee Moodasee one of the eldest and most knowledgeable and respected candidates. He spoke some English and like most of the main diamond dealers was a Banian. Banians who take their name from banik meaning merchant were predominantly high caste Hindus. Vog jee lived at Rammalakota called Ramalconeta by Cholmley a mine in the kingdom of Vijayapura that was the place for the procuring of Bort and Launall and for small diamonds 2 or 5 in a carratt. Although small the diamonds from here were generally of an excellent crystalline water have a bright clear skin inclining frequently to a pale greenish color are well shaped but few of them pointed ones. To avoid pushing diamond prices up by showing too much enthusiasm buyers were advised to take things slowly and ask for samples. Nathaniel had paid Vogjee 2 percent commission for obtaining diamonds presumably the going rate. Nathaniel also advises on other commissions what pay servants expected and so on. Next comes a suggestion verging on the unethical. There were two types of weights used for diamonds both confusingly called mangeleens various spellings are recorded. T he small mangaleen was about 1.4 carats the great mangaleen was about 1.9 carats. Nathaniel craftily notes that No European ever bought and accounted by the great Mangaleen 266  Diamond Trade in Indiabut myself and the merchants are rather inclined to sell by the small making an Advantage go by itt as I have. Perhaps unnecessarily he points out It will be very necessary that you get the Calculation betweene the Carett and the great Mangaleen perfectly in your memory. The equation of one mangaleen with 1.4 carats can be seen on invoices for diamonds consigned by Mathew Empson and Abraham Pluymer in Madra to Sir Stephen Evance a goldsmith in London in around 1700 where weights in both units are provided British Library Mss. Eur. D874. Tavernier also noted the distinction between the mangelin of Rammalakota which he says was 7 grains 1.75 carats and that used at Golconda and Bijapore which was 5 grains 1.25 carats Ball 1889 1333 26970 29899.3 Despite his rather cavalier treatment of weights Cholmley was meticulous in recording and segregating the diamonds as they were bought. His practice when buying was to have severall little Baggs. He had one Bagg for Stones of 15 of a Mangalleen one for 14 one for 13 one for 12 for 34 for 1 Mangaleen and so upwards as far as necessary. As he bought each stone or parcel he put the stones in the relevant bag with a Tickett specifying the cost of the stones or parcel. Then he entered into his accounts a record of the bags noting the number of rough diamonds their total weight and total cost. Another letter in the Cholmley correspondence advises that when selling parcels should contain varying weights of diamonds presumably because they provided the buyer with greater choice Cholmley 166493 fols. 01400141. Cholmley also urged his colleagues to learn the language of the Moors as soon as possible to get best advantage. A century earlier Richard Hakluyt had advised the simpler expedient of taking a trustie interpretour in the Eastern Arabian tongue Jones 1850 171. Cholmley also notes that the diamond merchants custom was to charge 5 percent commission plus 2 percent traveling charges including guards Diamond Trade in India  267when you went to the mines or just the 5 percent if the diamonds were purchased from those who carried them to the coastal markets. Once obtained the diamonds in their little leather pouches were sealed in a wooden box and entrusted to the captain or purser of an East India Company ship heading back to England Samuel 2003. The nancial and contractual side of shipping and what happened once the diamonds reached England has been discussed in detail by Edgar Samuel Samuel 197880 Samuel 2003. Like most who combined East India Company employment with diamond dealing Nathaniel Cholmley was accused of various wrongdoings. One said he had noe skill in Dyamonds. His brother dismissed this as meere malice and we today appreciative of the information he provides for us about the day to day business of diamond buying in India are lik ely to dismiss it as sour grapes Cholmley 166493 fol. 0137. Cholmley doesnt say much about Indian diamond dealers but for an insight here we have two descriptions that are remarkably similar despite being written some two centuries apart. Tavernier describes meeting a poorly clot hed Banian. The Banian o ered some small rubies in rings and then seeing that Tavernier was interested in better pieces suggested a later more secluded meeting. At this the Banian removed his simple headdress and untwisted his hair to produce a rag in which was concealed a 48.5 carat diamo nd of beautiful water. Tavernier purchased it and later sold it to a Dutch captain for a fair prot Ball 1889 25051. The second account is from an English doctor Henry Moses who wrote an engaging account of his sojourn in India in the early nineteenth century From him the gem dealer may be purchased the most costly gems and though to all appearances a poor man he will often should you express a wish to purchase any of these adult playthings 268  Diamond Trade in Indiapull out from under his gown a dirty roll of linen in which he has folded an amount of treasure that astonishes you when spread out to view. Here is a bit of brown paper with a dia. mond wrapped up in it worth fty pounds Moses 1850 237. Indian Markets Diamonds could be bought at the mines or at markets that could be established at the major city in the region where the mines were situated often the capital or at coastal ports. For example Tavernier bought diamonds at Rammalakota in the Kingdom of Bijapur and at the Kollur modern Kolloru mine which belongs to the King of Golconda Ball 1989 270. In 1624 it was noted that Neare Vizapore Bijapur also an old mine doth a oard some and the Portugalls buy of them.  Such purchase of diamonds at the mines could be o icial or unoicial. Att the mines advised Cholmley you freely buy single stones of all sortes and small parcells. But large stones were usually the prerogative of the ruler leading some miners to give in to temptation and risk the dire penalties for theft. As Cholmley succinctly put it The wisest when they nd a great Stone conceal it till they have an opportunity and then with Wife and Children run away see appendix in this volume. An ancient glimpse of an Indian gem market comes in the Tamil classic Shilappadikaram believed to have been composed in the early centuries AD Krishnamoorthy 2011. Here Kovalan the son of a wealthy merchant visited Madurai an important Indian trading city as mentioned by several classical writers including Strabo Pliny and the author of the Periplus. The Mediterranean goods brought to Madurai to exchange for gems and other eastern luxuries included dancing girls and wine. It was a dancing girl that diverted Kovalan from his marriage and in his later attempt to patch things up he and his Diamond Trade in India  269wife sought to raise funds to start a business by selling her anklet of pure and beautifully worked gold set with rubies and diamonds. He went to the jewelry and gem market where he found traders skilled in judging the quality of precious stones and dealing in diamonds of the prescribed standard of quality which were free from the four faults crows feet black spots holes and lines which were of four dierent colors and which had an auspicious sheen. An early insight into what a modern diamond dealer would term the diamond pipe line is Garcia de Ortas description of how diamonds from the northern mines were brought to the market in Ellichpur to sell. Here many were purchased by Gujerati dealers who then took them to the market in Vijayanagar modern Hampi the huge bustling capital of the empire of the same name Markham 1913 345. De Orta was probably repeating a description of the situation around 1500 but the continued prominence of Gujerati in the trade is clearly shown by Nathaniel Cholmleys comment that the Banians of Guzzerat who for some Generations have forsaken their own Country to take up the Trade in which they have had such success that tis now solely engrosd by them who corresponding with their Country men in Surrat Goa Golconda Visiapore Bijapur Agra and Dillee Delhi and other places in India furnish them all with Diamonds. The centers Cholmley mentions here were then the primary diamond markets and can be considered in turn. Surat in Gujarat was a major seaport now the center of the Indian diamond cuttin g industry and with a long association with diamonds. Surastra is given as a source of diamonds in some early Indian texts including the Ratnapariksa lit. gemology of Buddha Bhatta probably dating from the early centuries AD Finot 1896 xxv. John Ovington chaplain to the East India Company equates this with the Sanskrit name for 270  Diamond Trade in IndiaSurat also probably the Saraostus of the rst century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and which survives in the name of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat state Ovington 1696 129n. Surat was important in the English diamond trade until superseded by Fort St. George Madras. In 1689 Ovington saw diamond cutting here and was o ered large diamonds to buy although under a veil of secrecy. He explained Those that dig the Ground are narrowly lookd to and examind at their Departure that nothing be privately conveyd or stole away and yet they sometimes escape all Discovery by slipping a Stone into their Mouths or thrusting it upwards in their lower Parts or by bribing of the Overseers. By this means we sometimes meet with large Stones very Valuable. Two I saw at Suratt the smaller was a sort of Table Diamond rated at Twelve Thousand Pounds the other was larger and exceeded the Price of the other almost Eight Thousand Pounds. All Stones of such a Size are Royalties and Sacred to the Crown and whoever nds them or wheresoever they are heard of they are presently seized and taken for the use of the Mogul. Therefore the Owner of these Noble Diamonds solemnly engaged our Secresie and bound us to Silence before we were permitted a sight of them Ovington 1696 199. Surat was also important to Armenian diamond dealers. T he French Catholic physician Gabriel Dellon who traveled to India in the late 1660s noted Suratte is a place of great Commerce Their Diamonds are brought thither out of the Kingdom of Golconda Dellon et al. 1698 28. His contemporary and compatriot Jean de Thvenot says much the same explaining that diamonds rubies and pearls were sold there along with all the other pretious Stones which are found in the East Thvenot 1687 17. Surat lay on the Gulf of Cambay at the head of which was the city of Cambay modern Khambhat an important trading center for the carnelian and agate Diamond Trade in India  271trade since antiquityand the Cambaet mentioned by Marco Polo. Here according to the fteenth century Pe rsian historian Mr Khvnd diamonds were available along with other gems Stevens 1715 93. De Orta includes Cambay as a source of diamonds and the Venetian traveler Caesar Fredericke refers to Portuguese merchants here as well as diamonds among the goods being sold Hakluyt 1599 343. De Laet also says that the Portuguese traditionally frequented Cambay whereas the English and Dutch frequented Surat Hoyland 1928 17 18. The di ering preference must reect the rise in prominence of Surat after the late fteenth century when the Cambay harbor began to silt up. The Dutch East India Company established its rst trading factory in Surat in 1612. Inland was Ahmedabad the capital and one of the main seats of Mughal power after its conquest by Akhbar in the 1570s. T he Mughals themselves were a major if not the major market for diamonds as well as other gems. According to de Laet in the seventeenth century Ahmedabad was almost as large as London Hoyland 1928 19. Diamonds were to be had here and indeed Tavernier re cords that in Ahmedabad h e purchased a diamond of some 157 carats which he had cut into a pear shaped rose of 9414 carats gure 13.3 Ball 1889 29899. T he Mughal court there attracted diamond dealers and such intermediaries as Shantidas whom East Indian Company documents describe as the Mughal emperor Jahangirs jeweler supplied the ruler and others sometimes inciting the rulers wrath for favoring business with the latter.4 Goa Further south on Indias west coast see the map in gure 12.5 Goa became the hub for Portuguese trade after it became a Portuguese colony in 1510 although their shipping of dia272  Diamond Trade in IndiaFigure 13.3. Large diamond as found left and as cut right after it was purchased by Tavernier. monds sourced from Vijayanagara Bijapur and Golconda only really grew later in the century Boyajian 1993 4950 68. T he Englishman probably Nathaniel Cholmley who visited the Indian diamond mines in the 1670s and whose account is quoted in full in the appendix to this volume noted that in about 1600 the Currure mine probably Wajra Karur near Bellary in Cholmleys day part of Golconda the most famous of them all and most ancient yielded a large stone and the lucky Portuguese nder immediately returned with his Stone to Goa. For a time the Goan diamond trade largely in the hands of New Christians supplied a major proportion of the diamonds entering Europe. The value carried is unknown since many of the diamonds and other gems were not recorded o icially but on the basis of contemporary estimates the economic historian James Boyajian suggests that the gems shipped from Goa in just one year1613may have been worth some two million cruzados in Lisbon Boyajian 1993 50. That works out at the equivalent of almost eight thousand kilos of gold. In 1636 the value shipped to Lisbon on just one carrack the Diamond Trade in India  273Nossa Senhora da Sade on behalf of twelve Goan New Christian merchants was about a quarter of this Boyajian 1993 217. From 1648 we have a description of Goa that says that there is managed all the tra ick for Diamonds and other Precious Stones which have made the Court of Madrid so pompus and full of Glittering Dillingham 1648. By this time however the rise in English and Dutch trade and the Portuguese rebellion against the Habsburgs meant that Lisbon was playing a greatly reduced role in the European diamond trade. A letter in the Cholmley archive seems to suggest that the Inquisition in Goa had some negative e ects on the gem trade there in the 1660s Cholmley 166493 fol. 0154. John Fryer described Goa as the only place of consequence in India retained by the Portuguese in his day the 1670s and 1680s and Goa and thus Lisbon retained some importance in the diamond trade into the eighteenth century. In 1725 the Caledonian Mercury reported that two ships from Goa had brought to Lisbon a great Number of Diamonds 29 October 1725. Goa was essentially a free port and one can imagine a very cosmopolitan trade. A view of Goa in the late 1500s is shown in gure 13.4. Van Linschoten tells us there were Christian diamond traders in Goa while John Fryer writes The great Traders of this Place for Diamonds are the two Martins both Jews Fryer 1698 183. The English exported some diamonds from there Samuel 2003 but the involvement of the English allowed as private diamond traders under East India Company rules after 1667 made the Madras Londo n trade increasingly important Prakash 1998 24142 see also Boyajian 1993 136. Golconda In recent years the name Golconda has taken on a nearly mythical status. Almost any ne quality of the right diamond type 274  Diamond Trade in Indiaand seemingly old that might be from India that comes on the market is liable to be garnished with the name Golconda and will be assured of a good price. In historical terms however Golconda could mean either the sultanate of that name which included some of the most famous diamond mines or the fort or castle of Golconda that is situated some six miles west of modern Hyderabad and was founded in 1512 as the capital of the Golconda Sultanate ruled by the Kutb Shahi dynasty. The king of Golcondas palace lay within the castle. T he old name for Hyderabad was Bagnagar as seen on the map in gure 12.6. Bagnagar was a large city the administrative capital of Golconda and a major commercial center. The French traveler Jean de Thvenot who was in India in 166667 mentions the many Rich Merchants Bankers and Jewellers and vast numbers of skilful Artisans in Hyderabad and in addition to Indian merchants those from Persia Armenia Portugal England and Holland Thvenot 1687 97. Diamond trading took place in both the Golconda castle and HyderabadBagnagar. Thvenot says I was at the castle at Golconda with a Hollander who bought a large diamond. . . .

When Tavernier tells us he was shown a large diamond of just over 242 carats the so called Grea t Table gure 13.5 when he was at Golconda in 1642 he presumably means in the fort. This he says is the largest diamond I have seen in India in the possession of merchants Ball 1889 298 Balfour 2009 8185. Nathaniel Cholmley explained that at Golconda as at Vijayapura there was an open market for diamonds and that the late deceased Abdul Cutopshah Abdullah Qutb Shah 1626 72 paid well for large stones but that his successor Abul Hasan Qutb Shah reigned 167286 showed more interest in female dancers and magicians.

Lower left is a Jesuit violated while to the right elegantly attired Dutchmen look on. Some diamonds may have been bought directly at the Golconda mines but not all diamonds bought at the Golconda castle were necessarily from the Golconda mines. Thvenot explains that although the Golconda mines brought great revenues to the king of Golconda His chief mines are in Carnates 276  Diamond Trade in IndiaCarnatic region in divers places towards Viziapour and he hath Six thousand Men continually at work there who daily f ind near three Pound weight and nobody digs there but for the king Thvenot 1687 102. Vijayanagara T he ruins of the capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom also called Vijayanagara can be seen at modern day Hampi some 17 5 miles east of Goa gure 13.7. It was a huge and vibrant city and its population in the sixteenth century has been estimated at half a million inhabitants probably around twice that of London during the same period Barbosa 1866 213. The city had long been a trading center for diamonds. According to a carved inscription dated 1336 diamonds from mines in an area called Vajra Bhandar were brought to the city of Vijayanagara for sale Panjikar and Ramchandran 2005. This suggestion of an ancient open market for diamonds is supported by the Timurid chronicler Abd al Razzq Samarqand who visited in the 1440s and says that the jewellers sell publicly in the bazaars pearls rubies emeralds and diamonds Sewell 1900 90. As noted above Garcia de Orta tells of diamonds being traded in Vijayanagara including diamonds from the northern mines brought by Gujaratis. He also reports being shown several large diamonds in the city including one the size of a small hens egg. His contemporary and compatriot Duarte Barbosa similarly tells us that diamonds were traded in the city and that the streets were lled with an innumerable crowd of all nations and creeds for besides many Moorish Arab merchants and traders and the Gentile Hindu inhabitants of the country . . . an innite number of others ock there from all parts who are able to come dwell trade and live very freely Barbosa 1866 8586. Another Portuguese traveler Domingos Paes visited Vijayanagara in the 278  Diamond Trade in India1520s and described the city Going forward you have a broad and beautiful street full of rows of ne houses and streets of the sort I have described and it is to be understo od that the houses belong to men rich enough to a ord such. In this street live many merchants and there you will nd all sorts of rubies and diamonds and emeralds and pearls and seed pearls . The diamond trade was particularly important as Paes said In this city you will nd men belonging to every nation and people because of the great trade which it has and the many precious stones there principally diamonds Sewell 1900 25556. Later in the sixteenth century in 1585 the London merchant Ralph Fitch ed from Goa and arrived in Vijayanagara which he calls Bellargan where there is a great market kept of diamonds rubies sapphires and many other soft stones. However by his time the kingdom had been conquered and the city was in decline and indeed Fitch then traveled to Bijapur a very great town where the king doth keep his court. The image of a happy cosmopolitan life at Vijayanagara provided by some observers is in contrast to the political shenanigans going on. At this period according to the Victorian historian James Talboys Wheelers characteristically imperialist account The Hindu court of Vijayanagar was distracted by a series of treacheries assassinations and butcheries equally revolting and bewildering. It would be tedious to unravel the story Wheeler 1880 94. Bijapur Bijapur may only have become an important diamond trading center after the 1560s following its conquest of Vijayanagara. A comment in the Rajsagarsuri Nirvanrasa of Tilaksagar dating to the 1660s says that Bijapur was then both a diamond mining and trading center Mehta 1991 96. Nathaniel Cholmley notes Diamond Trade in India  279Figure 13.7. The Vithala temple and pillared market in Hampi built in the sixteenth century. Credit Muthuraman VaithinathanAlamy. 280  Diamond Trade in India that although at the mines all diamonds over a certain weight were supposed to be sold to the king in Bijapur there was an open market and that the previous king Edelshaw presumably Ali Adil Shah II 165772 not only would give very high prices for large stones but rewarded the sellers with horses and other valuable gifts. Other Markets We know little about diamond trading at Agra and Delhi other than that the Mughal court at Agra was a buyer of good stones. Numerous other places are also cited as sources of diamonds. Barbosa refers to diamonds being traded at Calicut and Malabar. Calicut now known as Kozhikode is on the Kerala coast and was a major ancient trading port visited by European Jewish Arab and Chinese traders. A report of a Dutch voyage to India in about 1603 explained how along the Kerala coast the locals came aboard to trade pearls rubies sapphires and diamonds the writer warned goe not ashoare to trust them. In the rst century AD the Periplus notes that all kinds of precious stones including adamas could be traded from the ports of Muziris and Nelkynda both probably in Kerala southern India Casson 1989 8485 223. Another ancient source of diamonds in Sanskrit texts is Sopara with variant spellings which is presumably the ancient trading port of that name on Indias west coast now a suburb of Mumbai Finot 1896 xxvi. Later there must have been some diamond trading activity in Mumbai. In 1675 the Portuguese viceroy in Goa Luiz de Mendona Furtado de Albuquerque prohibited the Goa diamond dealers from dispatching or selling any diamonds to the English but the dealer s simply o ered to take the diamonds to the English further north up the coast in Mumbai Fawcett 1936 117 165. Marco Polo says that in his day the only supply of diamonds was in the kingdom of Mutli Yale and Cordier 1993 236062. These were perhaps diamonds traded from inland to the once important port now insignicant village Motupalli on the coast some seventy miles southwest of Masulipatam and the nearest eastern seaboard port to the diamond mines around Raichur. The earliest East India Company presence in India was at Masulipatam some three hundred miles north of Chennai Madras where the rst factors were put ashore in 1611. This remained the East India Company headquarters in India until 1641 when it was relocated to Fort St. George later known as Madras then Chennai. Even then Fort St. George was second in importance to the English Factory at Bantam in Java until it was raised to a Presidency in 1652. It lost this status three years later but regained it in 1684. An early eighteenth century Diamond Trade in India  281account noted that when the English rst settled at Fort St. George the town seemed by Nature designed only for shermen and the country for Shepherds. But its importance grew and it soon showed a prospect of Inclosures and Avenues green Walks broad shady Trees and owry Gardens British Library MS IORG4026. T he Russian traveler Afanasy Nitkin had spent several years in India in the fteenth century. He mentioned the diamond mines at Rachoor the Raichur area and noted that there were three hundred diamond dealers then residing at Kooroola Major 1857 21 30. Unfortunately the identity of his Kooroola is uncertain. It probably equates with the Kolluri of the early sixteenth century J awhir Nma s ince both place it near Gulbargamodern Kalaburagiand say that carnelian was worked there Digby 2008. Diamonds could be purchased in Kalaburagi and sold to Europeans for a large prot Digby 2008 Bournoutian 2006 458. Other identications of Kooroola such as with Kerala or the diamond mine at Kollur seem unlikely. Kerala was far down on the western coast and the Kollur mine was probably not discovered until later. Another possibility is the mine at Wajra Kurur. T he accounts of Europeans such as Tavernier and Cholmley provide us with a good idea of the trade in diamonds in India in the 1600s and of the quantities being mined. Our knowledge of earlier periods is far sketchier. Nitkins report of three hundred diamond dealers at Kooroola even if an exaggeration shows that there must have been signicant mining and a signicant market for diamonds in fteenth century India. Pa rt of this must have been a home market. The thirteenth century Pe rsian writer Mohammed ben Mansur said that the export of diamonds had formerly been forbidden indicating considerable home demand Hammer 1818 132. That huge stores of diamonds had been built up in India is shown by Nitkins de282  Diamond Trade in Indiascription of the immense quantity of precious stones sapphires and diamonds seized by the Moslems in their ghts against the Hindus Major 1857 26. He adds that Melikh Tuchar Mahmud Gawan known as Malik al Tujjaking of merchants gave orders that none of them should be sold to foreign traders again indicating a desire to keep diamonds in India and proving that foreign traders were hoping to buy. Thus it is likely that the Indian diamonds entering the European trade in the seventeenth century were not all freshly mined. The French jeweler and traveler Augustin Hiriart who was in India in the second decade of the seventeenth century commented of Janghir that as for diamonds he has more than all the princes of the world put together Frmont 1990. William Hawkins Lieutenant General of the third East India Company voyage to the east was more specic estimating that the treasury of the Mughal emperor Jahangir at Agra included 82.5 pounds just over 137000 carats of uncut diamonds of all types but none under two and a half carats Foster 1921b 102 untold riches for then. As a comparison the Orapa diamond mine in Botswana produces around 12 million carats per year but most well under 2.5 carats. Diamond Trade in India  283T he explorer and writer Sir Richard Bur ton asse rted that diamond cutting originated in India and a little before the fourteenth century drifted like the cholera of modern days west Burton 1869 106n. The development of cutting in India will be covered in this chapter. Burton seems about right in his chronology and there is some evidence for early cutting or at least polishing in India. Also of course determining where diamond cutting originated depends on what we mean by diamond cutting. As we have already seen there are dierent ways to modify a dia14 Diamond Cutting in India and the East mond and these developed at dierent times and possibly in di erent places. T he Cutting Stages Ignoring the lapidary use of diamondthat is using diamond chips for drilling and engraving and diamond powder for polishing themwe can distinguish  Cleaving splitting diamonds  Bruting which is rubbing two diamonds against each other to smooth edges or to adjust shape  Polishing the faces or edges of a diamond crystal or cleavage fragment by rubbing it on a xed at surface with diamond powder abrasive  Polishing a diamond on a scaife a at rotating cutting wheel fed with diamond p owder Detail of gure 14.3. 285Pounding diamond into chips for drilling and engraving was almost certainly an Indian innovation and seemingly practiced by the mid rst millennium BC. That diamonds cleave in certain crystallographic directions must have been noted rst when such diamond chips were being produced. I am unaware of any use of unpolished cleavage fragments in jewelry however and thus the intentional cleaving of diamonds served little purpose before polishing was developed. The same is true of bruting. T he production of diamond powder is likely to have been an Indian invention a natural lead on from the produc tion of diamond chips and an Indian origin for colored gem polishing using diamond powder seems almost certain. This technology had certainly reached the medieval Islamic and European worlds by around AD 1000 1250 and earlier use there and in India would not be unexpected. It is easy to imagine that slight polishing to improve the appearance of a natural diamond crystal was also rst attempted in India. India was after all the source of diamonds. It is uncertain whether more drastic improvement or modication of natural or cleaved diamond surface by rubbing on a smooth at surface with diamond dust was undertaken in India prior to its introduction further west. T he crank and driv e diamond cutt ing wheel was almost certainly a fteenth century Europ ean invention and what we can determine of diamond cutting in India and the regions on the trade route lands between there and the Mediterranean tends to reinforce this view. Turkey and Egypt T he earliest diamond cutter I am aware of in Ottoman Constantinople is one noted as being of Egyptian origin and registered in the city during the reign of Selim I reigned 151220 286  Diamond Cutting in IndiaAtil 1987 117. However Venetian merchants had been active in Constantinople and Alexandria for several centuries by then so if there had been cutting prior to the sixteenth century it may well have been introduced from Europe. By the late seventeenth century cutting was well established in Constantinople and Evliya Efendi who trained as a goldsmith there reported that there were forty ve diamond c utters in the city Efendi 1834 192. For a cutter of Egyptian origin to be in Constantinople by the early 1500s implies that diamond cutting existed in Egypt presumably Alexandria prior to this. The move of a diamond cutter from Egypt to Constantinople might relate to Selim Is conquest of Egypt in 1517. Or it might tie in with the decline of European mercantile interests there after the opening up of a direct sea trade between Lisbon and India by the Portuguese a decade or so earlier. The rise in Portugals prominence in the diamond trade may have led to an inux of those involved in the diamond industry from Alexandria. Gem specialist Wallis Catelle said with regard to Jewish cutters in Lisbon that Their forefathers are said to have come originally from Alexandria but he provides no reference for this statement Catelle 1911 118 Heertje 1936 12. Even if there was established diamond cutting in Egypt prior to the fteenth century it may well have been introduced by Europeans since the city had long established Venetian Genoese and other European traders. Syria and the Levant Further east we might expect to nd diamond cutters in major centers such as Aleppo in Syria by the later medieval period. However there are no Arabic sources to my knowledge that mention the cutting of diamond there prior to the period at Diamond Cutting in India  287which diamonds were being cut in Europe. An Englishman Peter Biddulph Lapidarie and Diamond cutter was in the Levant in the rst decade of the seventeenth century perhaps at Aleppo and he probably wasnt unique Osborne 1745 763. Aleppo was then a huge trading entrept bustling with Venetian Armenian and other merchants including diamond dealers but there is sparse evidence for diamond cutting. We know of an Armenian jeweler Murad Sargis kahana Haleptsi 15921662 who polished and set precious stones and buys and sells them in Aleppo but diamonds were not necessarily among those Bournoutian 2006 455. The Jawhir Nma Book of stones a treatise on gems of the early sixteenth century describes the sale of Indian diamonds to the Europeans in Syria and comments that there are none in the habitable world other than Europeans who have skill in the cutting of diamonds Digby 2008. This might suggest that European diamond cutters were present in Aleppo then. One of Arakel of Tabrizs chapters on gems in his seventeenth century History derived in part from the Jawhir Nma s imilarly explains that only Europeans understood how to polish diamonds and reported those of Aleppo in Syria as saying that diamond was no use unless polished Bournoutian 2006 459. The original text was the Jawhir nma i Humyn composed in 1527 by Muhammad Ashraf al Husayn al Rustamdr and dedicated to H umayun the son and heir of the Mughal emperor Babur. A mid nineteenth century copy of this text is in the British Museum Rieu 1883 99596. There is also an abbreviated version in the British Museum as well as the copy cited above studied by Simon Digby Rieu 1881 78990 Digby 2008. 288  Diamond Cutting in IndiaIran T he situation regarding early diamond cutting in Iran and central Asia is tantalizing. There is a group of gold necklet or belt elements of about the fourteenth century in the Khalili collection probably from Iran or the northern Black Sea coast Spink and Ogden 2013 242223 cat. 319. Two of these ornaments are shown in gure 14.1. Some of these ornaments are set with small blue glass cabochons of sapphire color shown at right and these are intended presumably to imitate the little sapphire cabochons well known in medieval jewelry. The other mounts are set with small square cut p ieces of colorless glass in exactly the form of simple table cut diamonds sho wn at left. Colorless glass doesnt look its best in a gold setting and it is diicult to explain this choice of color and shape unless the inla ys were intended to imitate the appearance of table cut diamonds. If so  do these imitation diamonds imply the use of genuine table cut diamonds in the region at that period or were they just local copies of what were in use further west or in India When the French jeweler Jean Chardin later Sir John Chardin described lapidary workers there in the late seventeenth century he explained how they used bow powe red equipment and commented It is di icult to make very straight a Stone that way Penzer 1927. This type of bow powe red cutting wheel was the same as that traditionally used in India gure 14.2. Chardin made no specic mention of diamond cutting in Persia. Indeed a lack of such craftsmen at the time is indicated by the request of Sa Shah of Iran 162942 to King Charles I in England to send a diamond cutter and a similar request of Suleiman I Shah 166694 to Charles II Matthee 1998 236. I n the 1670s Anthony Munster a Dutch diamond cutter who had set o  to work in Moscow was taken to Isfahan as a slave but it is unclear if he was expected to work at his craft there Struys and Diamond Cutting in India  289Figure 14.1.

When the English merchant Jonas Hanway recounted his travels in Iran in the 1740s he observed one of the Shahs sets of horse trappings set with diamonds most of which were so prodigious a size as hardly to merit belief for many of them appeared as big as a pigeons egg. I could not but regard them with wonder not for their immense value than for the barbarous taste in which they were set for some of them did not appear to have any art bestowed on them. He commented that jewels in Europe appear incomparably brighter and neater set and that if his majesty would trust me with one of those bridles I would procure a complete horse furni ture to be made in Europe Hanway 1753 255. The shah replied that he has not patience enough to wait till it should be nished. When the Gentlemans Magazine cited this story some years later it prefaced it with the note It is well known that diamonds are cut to perfection in Europe only. 1 Either the Iran diamond cuttin g skills were none too impressive or the diamonds were typical Indian cut stones. H owever cutting seems to have been established in Iran by the end of the eighteenth century. In 1792 the French diplomat Pierre Joseph de Beauchamp said It is unnecessary to mention those arts in which they the Iranians excel as they may be seen in Chardin but it may be proper to mention the new ones which they now have as enamel which they execute with great delicacy and the cutting of diamond Beauchamp 1792. Early Cutting in India When we turn to India we have the benet of several early texts that describe diamonds at length but it is not always possible to interpret them with certainty. In his study of Indian lapidaries Louis Finot described a section of the Ratnaparks of Buddha Bhatta which may date to as early as the sixth century and which itself was derived from earlier texts as saying that before being mounted diamonds underwent an operation called parikarman which made use of diamonds of too poor a quality for ornamental use Finot 1896 xxx. However the translation he provides alongside the relevant text far more mundanely Figure 14.2. A gem cutter Patna India ca. 1826. Credit Victoria and Albert Museum London IS.48 1964. Diamond Cutting in India  291says my translation from his French The wise should not use for adornment a diamond that has a visible defect. It can only be used for polishing gems. Finot translated the Sanskrit parikarman as polishing although the word usually means something like preparation or cleansing. The passage is still deemed problematic by Sanskrit scholars but it seems likely that the Ratnaparks says nothing about diamond powder being used to polish diamond simply that poor quality diamonds were employed for working other gems. Whether this implies the use of diamond powder for polishing colored gems or just drilling or engraving is uncertain. A reference to diamond cutting has also been said to be found in the Agastimata a work of uncertain date written by the Indian sage Agastya. One paragraph seems to mention cleaving a diamond but it is highly ambiguous apparently saying that the virtue of a diamond will be reduced if one strikes it like a nail with a deadly instrument Finot 1896 8788. Another passage in this text appears more specic. In Finots opinion this says that diamond cannot be cut with metals or other gems but diamond is cut by diamond Finot 1896 78 90. However the Sanskrit word translated by Finot as cut is bhidyate which has a range of meanings the overall sense of which includes alter win over split and break. Perhaps the best that can be said of this Sanskrit text is that it provides a possible reference to the awareness that one diamond could scratch or abrade another. The latter had been recognized earlier in the Garuda Puranam a Sanskrit book probably written during the period of the Brahmanic revival in the Gupta period in the fourth to fth centuries AD Dutt 1908 i iii 186. Her e the statement is included in a section on imitation diamonds and their detection because the knowledge that a true diamond can be scratched only by another diamond was important for a gemologist. 292  Diamond Cutting in IndiaT he date of the Agastimata is uncertain. When Thakkura Pheru wrote his Rayanaparikkha Gemology in 1315 he noted In olden times manuals on gemtesting were written by B haspati Agastya and Buddhabhatta so at least part of the Agastimata was old then. Its appendix appears less ambiguous. It says again from Finots French translation The stone diamond that is cut with a blade or by repeated friction becomes useless and loses its benecial properties Finot 1896 xxxxxxi 139. T his sounds like diamond cleaving and polishing but this appendix is possibly a later addition. Berthold Laufer concluded that it fell within the time of the Portuguese era of India that is post1500 Finot 1896 xxxi Laufer 1915 48. T he inscriptions in the central shrine in the Tanjavur Temple in southern India of about AD 1000 mentioned in chapter 3 might point to some diamond polishing if not more sophisticated cutting in Medieval India Hultzsch 1891 40 81 and passim. These describe the various diamonds set in the donated gold jewelry as crystals smooth diamonds square diamonds with smooth edges at diamonds with smooth edges and round diamonds Hultzsch 1891 40 81 and passim. Indeed the Sanskrit agastyasamhita probably no earlier than the twelfth century includes descriptions of two tools which have been suggested to be for working of diamonds. The chedanavjra was a diamond with a notched cutting edge attached to the drill and used for grinding the diamond to the desired shape Singh 2006 4034. This might refer to bruting of sorts although it may simply have meant some sort of tool for grinding other gems to shape. However the upamrajanavjra was a tool with a smooth surface and used for polishing diamond Singh 2006 404. In view of the lack of mentions of diamond polishing in other Indian texts a smooth surface used in conjunction with diamond powder for polishing other gems might be meant here. However the possibility remains that we have Diamond Cutting in India  293evidence that the polishing of diamonds in India by the twelfth centurya date that would t in well with the earliest diamond cutting in Europe. T hakkura Pheru in the early fourteenth century said that diamond can cut diamond. This might refer to diamond cutting but again may just have meant that Pheru knew that a diamond could be scratched by another diamond Sarma 1984 51 36. He specically noted that diamonds could not be ground on the traditional Indian lapidary wheel and it seems likely that if he was aware they could be cut in other ways he would have said so. Nevert heless it is di icult to imagine that the Indians had not experimented with polishing diamonds by the later medieval period despite the inauspicious nature of the act. Pheru does make the strange remark that it was a fault to set a diamond upside down with a small face at the top a large one below. Could this be a reference to a simple table cut European table cut colored gems ar e sometimes seen set upside down in later Mughal ornament presumably because their bottom heavy proportions would not permit them to be set the right way up in the characteristic Mughal kundun setting Ogden 2013 36263. Victor Meen and Arlotte Tushingham respectively gemologist and chief archaeologist at the Royal Ontario Museum also noted many gems mounted upside down in the Iranian crown jewels Meen and Tushingham 1968 38. Sanskrit texts had repeatedly said that misshaped broken or poor quality diamonds lacked benecial qualities an Indian prejudice noted by Islamic writers such as the medieval Persian scholar al Brn who said The p eople of Indian prefer the diamond that is unbroken and whole in shape with its sides sharp. T hey do not like diamonds with broken sides. In fact they tend to regard this as an evil portent. Possibly this is so because such a diamond has been overcome by something else Said 1989 78. An early European recognition of this by Garcia de Orta 294  Diamond Cutting in Indiawas expressed in more colorful terms. He asserted Indians said that as a virgin is more valuable than a woman who is not one so the Naife uncut diamond is worth more than the cut one Markham 1913 345. European Cutting in India One of de Ortas compatriots and one of the rst Europeans to sail to India the Portuguese traveler and writer Duarte Barbosa seems to have noted local diamond cutting. Barbosa traveled east in 1501 writing his account a dozen or so years later Barbosa 1866 1221. He tells us that the diamonds from the new mine were worked in the kingdom of Narsynga Vijayanagar that is Hampi itself. In contrast the oldmine diamonds those to the north were not worked in India Barbosa 1866 213. This suggests that diamond cutting was practiced at the southern group of diamond mines prior to the Portuguese opening up the direct sea trade. Possible corroboration for this is found in the account of the Russian Afanasy Nikitin who visited India around 1470 and mentioned the diamond mines at Raichurprobably one and the same as Barbosas Narsynga mines Major 1857 21. Nikitins text in Old Russian with borrowed Persian words is problematic but he referred to two di erent categories of diamond available there at signicantly di erent prices. The text could be read to suggest a distinction between worked and unworked diamonds but other interpretations are no doubt possible including a distinction between diamonds suitable for ornamental use and those only useful for crushing and employing in lapidary work. Garcia de Orta observed that when diamonds were sold at the market in Hampi these diamonds of the old rock fetch a very high price especially those they call Naifes being those which nature has worked while the Portuguese value those Diamond Cutting in India  295most which have been polished. It is unclear whether he was noting a general Portuguese preference or implying that cut diamonds were also available at the market in Hampi Markham 1913 346. Indian gold ornaments set with diamonds were being sent back to Portugal in the early 1500s but there seems to be no description as to whether these were cut stones or not. An example is a gold belt studded with numerous colored gems and four diamonds that left India in 1513 en route to Manuel I of Portugal and had been sent by Governor Albuquerque Crespo 2015 22. A Portuguese manuscript in the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal in Lisbon dating to around 156080 however comments that diamonds cut in India fell short of European standards and were thus recut Silva 1993 22. This is perhaps the earliest of many European comments about the poor quality of Indian cut diamonds. A note by Richard Hakluyt dated February 1600 gives prices to be paid for various products primarily spices in the East Indies. Included here are diamonds rough fully worked and chapas meaning plates and thus cleavage fragments or thin Indian cut tables J ones 1850 159. Most of the European diamond cutters in India in the sixteenth century were probably Italians but not all. Belgian professor John Everaert has pointed out that there were also some Germans and Flemings Everaert 2000 9293 Everaert 2004. Among the latter was the ill fated Frans Co ningh or Coninck a diamond cutter from Antwerp. Coningh had spent some time in London in his youth then around 1580 went to live with his uncle in Venice before leaving for the Levant in 1581. He spent some time and much of his money in Aleppo then traveled on to Goa where in 1588 he was murdered by his young adulterous wife and her lover Burnell and Tiele 1885 20415. An engraving of this horric assassination was included in a French 296  Diamond Cutting in Indiaedition of Jan Huygen van Linschotens Itinerario Linschoten and Paludanus 1610 216. European Cutters at the Mughal Court Mughal India has provided us with a remarkable early representation of a European diamond cutter. The so called Golan Album is an album of paintings and calligraphy formerly preserved in its entirety in the Golestn Palace Library in Tehran but now with some pages dispersed in various collections. The calligraphy pages probably date mainly to the sixteenth century but of relevance here are the margin paintings added to these in the early seventeenth. One of these pages of exquisite calligraphy had its margin embellished with gures painted at about the time of Jahangirs accession probably by the artist Nar Singh. These include two seated males a partly draped angel in Renaissance European style and three women at top left is a beautifully rendered representation of a man in European dress standing at a diamond cuttin g mill gure 14.3. Many of the marginal paintings in the album appear to be based on European originals but the very non European wa y in which the perspective was handled here shows that the artist must have observed an actual mill of traditional European type as in gure 6.8. 2 We dont know if this depiction was recognition of Jahangirs existing interest in diamond cutting or an inspiration to him but diamond cutters were soon evident in his court. William Hawkins went to India with the third East India Company voyage to negotiate trade with Jahangir. He recounts how in 1607 just two years after his accession Jahangir summoned a diamond cutter to his court to cut a large diamond. The cutter demanded a small foule diamant to make powder wherewith to cut the other diamant. They brought him a chest as Diamond Cutting in India  297Figure 14.3.

As an aside we can note that Hawkins had been warmly welcomed by Jahangir who according to custom wished to pre sent him with a wife. To avoid this without o ending the emperor  Hawkins explained that as a Christian he could only marry a Christian woman. So Jahangir produced a beautiful Armenian girl to whom Hawkins readily assented to be married. Hawkins died on the voyage back to Britain in 1613 and his body and Armenian widow were brought to his home in Ireland. She was left alone among strangers in a strange land but she had a very ne diamond worth 2000 and some smaller ones worth 4000 so that she had no di iculty in nding another English Husband. She married Gabriel Towerson who had sailed east in the same voyage as Hawkins in 1614 and they returned to Agra in 1617. She remained in Agra after Towerson went to the Moluccas when appointed chief East India Company factor there. He was killed in the massacre of the English by the Dutch at Amboyana in 1623 Seth 1937 99100. It is unclear whether the cutter summoned to Jahangirs court was one the emperor used regularly or was specially brought in for a one o job. Th e cutters inability to nd suitable poor quality diamond in the emperors store of diamonds to crush to use as abrasive might point to the latter. However in 1618 some of the diamonds sent to Jahangir in Agra from the diamond mines at Kokhra were given to the Government lapidaries to cut. So by then at least Jahangir had his own diamond cutters. We can gain an idea of who they were from an account written by Edward Terry chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe who was in India in 161719. Terry true to his Church of England disposition reported that the Jesuits in the East Indies despite their boastings actually had had little success and adds that the Jesuit congregations there are very thin consisting of some Italians which the Mogul entertains by great pay given them to cut his diamonds and other rich stones Terry 1777 427. Not all the cutters were Italians. Abraham a Dutch diamond cutter in the service of Jahangir went to Vijayapur in 1617 with the Mughal ambassador to buy diamonds Kruijtzer 2009 24. In 1647 Shah Jahan Jahangirs son heard of a very ne diamond from a mine in the south and commanded that it be sent to him as part of the annual tribute Azz 1942 180 Elliot 1875 90. By the time the local ruler received this demand his cutters had already started cutting the stone so it was sent partly cut Diamond Cutting in India  299to Shah Jahan who had his workmen complete it. The stone rough had weighed 180 ratis about 160 carats and after cutting to disclose all its beauties there remained a rare gem of 100 ratis weight valued by the jewelers at one lac and 50000 rupees. The nationality of these cutters is unknown. Nor do we know the nationality of the cutters that Jean de Thvenot tells us the king of Golconda had working on Stones of consequence within his palace lesser stones were worked within the fort but not in the palace itself Thvenot 1687 99. The palace jewelers were entrusted with the ne stones with strict instructions to be discrete least if Aurangzeb should come to know that his workmen are employed about Stones of great value he might demand them of him Thvenot 1687 99. When Shah Jahan received a particularly large diamond found at Kollur the cutter of this was supposedly a Venetian. He is best known to us under the name Tavernier uses Hortensi o Borgiobut Borges was his wifes name and it was Hortenzio Bronzoni of Venice that was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Agra in August 1677 Ball 1889 131516 Blunt 1911 42. The Italian Niccolao Manucci gives the diamond cutters name as Ortenio Bronzoni when he recounts the story of the large diamond Irvine 1907 123738. It has been stated that this cemetery has graves of Italians employed as diamond cutters Anon 1853 Chunder 1869 416. Terry had referred earlier to Italian Jesuit diamond cutters in Agra but Bronzoni with a wife was clearly not a Jesuit.3 Cutters with the European Trading Companies T he diamond cutters Tavernier noted at the Rammalakota mines may well have been Indian but at least some European cutters in India found work with the English Dutch and other trading companies. In April 1623 the Dutch had framed a mill in there 300  Diamond Cutting in Indiahouse at Bander Bandar the port at Masulipatam to facilitate their diamond business. This is the earliest record I know of one of the European trading companies establishing cutting in India. A couple of weeks later the Dutch sent a diamond merchant and a lappadariea cutter to the new Golconda mine at Kollur Foster 1908 221 229. Fifteen years later we hear how another Dutchman Barent Pessaert then president of the Danes at Machilipatnam hath of late made a journey to the dyamond mynes where he hath bought a great quantity rough and procurd a man to cleanse them in this place Foster 1912 65. Cleanse meant cut. The East India Company seemed less interested in establishing cutting in India. The Cholmley archive includes a letter written in December 1688 from John Cholmley to his brother Nathaniel in India that mentions the possibility of sending a diamond cutter to India Cholmley 166493 fol. 0133 4. This seems not to have been taken up but in 1696 a syndicate of London jewelers organized by Sir Francis Child sent 2500 in silver to India with a Dutch diamond cutter called Abraham Pluymer in order to invest in diamonds making a 130 percent prot on the diamonds they received Samuel 1977 5253. In view of the importance of diamond cutting in later seventeenth century Lo ndon it is surprising that there are few specic references to English diamond cutters in India until the later eighteenth century. One of the rst mentions is found in a 1751 will for John Phillips who was described as a diamond cutter and bound for Fort Saint David near Cuddalore by then the British headquarters in southern India National Archives PROB 1179015. Tavernier also mentions another Dutchman in India David Bazu who cleaved a diamond of about 104 carats after the Banian merchants had turned it down Ball 1889 1xlix 299. He risked much in cleaving this stone and it was a great piece of good luck for him that it did not break into a hundred fragDiamond Cutting in India  301ments. Still for all that it did not repay him this makes it su iciently plain that where the Banians refuse to bite there is nothing to be hoped for by the Franks Europeans. This Bazu a rival to Tavernier also sold important diamonds to Louis XIV and landed Tavernier in trouble with the customs o ice in Ezurum in Armenia on his return from his sixth voyage east Ogden 2017. T he traditional method of cleaving a diamond was explained by Jean de Thvenot a French traveler who visited Golconda in the 1660s When they Indians would cut a diamond to take out some grain of sand or other imperfection they nd in it they saw it a little in a place where it is to be cut and then laying it upon a hole that is in the piece of wood they put a little wedge of iron upon the place that is sawed and striking it as gently as may be it cuts the Diamond through Thvenot 1687 99. The reference to sawing here is the small notch to facilitate the splitting. Indians were considered experts in the art of cleaving and indeed Thvenots compatriot the diamond merchant Tavernier noted that those working at the diamond mines at Rammalakota were much more accomplished at cleaving than were the Europeans. Other Europeans reported much the same Paulinus 1800 392. There seems to be no clear evidence that Indians sawed diamonds indeed Thvenot seems to contrast the cleaving of diamonds as just noted with the way Indians sawed sapphires with a wire bow saw in conjunct ion with emery powder in water Thvenot 1687 99. Mughal Appreciation of European Cuts T he Mughal emperors appreciation of cut diamonds continued through the seventeenth century and they seem to have had a penchant for stones cut by Europeans. Bear in mind that in the early decades of the seventeenth century the European rose cut 302  Diamond Cutting in Indiawas the most sophisticated cut the brilliant would not be introduced until several decades later. T he French textile trader George Roques tells us that after the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb Shah Jahans son conquered Golconda in the late 1680s he closed the diamond mines because with his own and the looted stones he had su icient diamonds but now wished to swap his rough diamonds for cut stones since he only loved cut stones Voillot 1998 1067. In one case he apparently swapped his rough diamonds with cut diamonds from two French traders even though his rough was worth the double of their stones. In 1698 John Fryer commented French and Dutch Jewelers coming over Land . . . made good Purchase by buying jewels here India and carrying them into Europe to be Cut and Set and returning sell them here to the Ombrahs court grandees among them Monsieur Tavernier and now Monsieur Rezin and Monsieur Jardin Fryer 1698 8889. This is reminiscent of the early sixteenth century Jawhir Nma which sta ted a rough diamond might be bought in India at four orins per carat but that When it falls into the hands of the European cutter and he carves it and it is afterwards brought back to Hind India it is possible that it will be bought at 15 orins a carat. However it is unclear why the Mughals wanted European cut stones some tw o centuries after diamond cutting had been established in India and almost a century after Jahangir had his own court diamond cutters. T he Shortcomings of Indian Cutting Edward Terry in India in 161719 praised Indian craftsmanship and noted how curious skillful they are in cutting all manne r of stones diamonds as well as others Terry 1777 12728. This is one of the few positive notes among the many derogatory comments made by Europeans about the quality Diamond Cutting in India  303of diamond cutting in India. An early negative comment was by the French traveler Pierre Olivie r Malherbe 15691611 who visited diamond mines in India at the beginning of the seventeenth century and observed that Indians were not good at cutting the stones Kundra 2014 20. When Tavernier described the numerous diamond cutters at the diamond mines at around 1640 he noted The Indians are unable to give the stones such a lively polish as we give them in Europe Ball 1889 243. The reason was that their wheels do not run so smoothly as ours. For being made of steel in order to grind it on t he emery . . . it has to be taken o  the tree i.e. its axis and cannot be replaced so as to run as evenly as it should do. If they possessed the iron wheel like ours for which not emery but the f ile is required it is not necessary to remove it from the tree in order to le it and they could give the stones a better polish than they do. John Fryer surgeon to the East India Company also refers to the use of steel diamond cuttin g wheels in Surat half a century later They cut Diamonds with a Mill turned by Man the String reaching in manner of our cutlers wheels to lesser that are in a at Press where under Steel wheels the Diamonds are fastened and with its own Bort are worn into what Cut the Artist pleases Fryer 1698 113. The references to steel wheels rather than iron ones mirror the descriptions of sixteenth century Europe an diamond cutting by Biringuccio and Cellini among others. The implication is that the cutters in seventeenth century India we re still using a form of equipment perhaps characteristically of Italian type that had been superseded in Europe. Cellini also noted that if you bear a su iciently heavy weight you can in  creas e the pressure of the diamonds upon the wheel. Tavernier a century later said that this was no longer European practice stating The Indians do not agree with us in believ304  Diamond Cutting in Indiaing that weighting them causes aws in the stone Ball 1889 245. He mentions a case where a diamond was weighted with 150 pounds of lead. Even as late as the mid eighteenth centur y David Je ries also noted that although most of the diamonds imported from India were not well cut there come now and then stones tolerably well wrought and polished but these have been supposed to have been done by Europeans and upon their mills and skeves scaifes and to have been the property of such i.e. Europeans Jeries 1751 121. In 1790 in Calcutta an Englishman Richard Brittridge announced that having procured the necessary implements for Cutting and Polishing Diamonds and having in employ European workmen of the rst Abilities in that line will engage to cut and polish Diamonds equal to those manufactured in Europe and on reasonable Terms  Calcutta Chronicle 2 November 1790. Despite his criticism about steel wheels and over weightin g Tavernier tells us that the typical mill at Rammalakota was like ours with a large wheel turned by four men Ball 1889 245. Two hundred years later Thomas Newbold an army o icer with the East India Company mentioned diamond cutting in the same area and noted that the cutters have long been famous for their skill as lapidaries Newbold 1843 231. He illustrates the component parts of the apparatus which has been used time out of mind by the diamond polishers of Munimudgoo a place where most of the diamonds found in the Pennar district were polished and sent to Golconda for sale Newbold 1843 23637. The mechanism he describes is essentially the same as the European mill but it has a simpler crank and the legs were sunk in the earth rather than being rigidly set on a sturdy London or Antwerp timber oor. From Newbolds drawings gure 14.4 and descriptions the two dont always equate and a reconstruction gure 14.5 it is hardly surprising Diamond Cutting in India  305that this style of Indian mill was less able to deliver minuscule perfection. Incidentally Newbold does describe the nine inch diameter scaife as be ing of iron. Cutting Styles in India T he drawings of the diamonds that Jean Baptiste Ta vernier sold to King Louis XIV of France provide a good introduction to the type of cutting being carried out in India in the seventeenth century. All were he says cut in India other than the few rough diamonds. There are four main classes  Thin rectangular or polygonal lasques  Table cuts  Multifaceted Mughal cuts  Irregular forms T he thin lasques ar e ubiquitous in Mughal ornament. These are thin cleavage slices the top and bottom faces of which have been polished as have the beveled edges. This shape is seen in Taverniers drawing gure 14.6. The diamond of this type in f igure 14.7 has beveled edges which retain much of the original crystal surface. The large quantity of such stones that have survived in Mughal jewelry Indians known prowess with cleaving and the poor regard for such cut stones in Europe suggest that this form was largely cut by Indian cutters. The simple table cuts sold by Tavernier could have been cut by Indians or Europeans. One he described weighed just over sixty three carats and was bought in the year 1653 at the Kollur mine. It is beautiful pure cut at the mine Ball 1889 299. 306  Diamond Cutting in IndiaFigure 14.4.  left  A nineteenth century Indian diamond cuttin g mill as drawn by Captain Newbold. After Newbold 1843.

Onnes van Nijenrod. 308  Diamond Cutting in India T he multifaceted type of cut what Herbert Tillander described as the Mughal cut may well have generally been cut by Europeans. These cuts are essentially European rose cuts as applied to larger diamonds of varied shapes. Europeans usually referred to them as roses. Tavernier had the 157 carat diamond h e bought in Ahmedabad cut into a pear shaped rose  of 9414 carats see f igure 13.3 Ball 1889 29899. A similarly shaped diamond of thirty two carats was described by him as a large diamond carr of almond shape Ball 1889 2 facing 100 top right Bapste 1889 403. Here he used the term carr to mean faceted in a general sense. The domed form of this gem with its attish underside and myriad triangular facets is close to that of the Great Moguls diamond originally from the Kollur mine that Tavernier says he was shown by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb the diamond supposedly cut by the Venetian Hortensio Borgio. Tavernier reports that it weighed about 280 carats when he saw it but it had weighed nearly three times that when rough Ball 1889 131516 297. It was he says the largest diamond he had seen in India a round rose the shape of half an egg. Valentine Ball has argued that this huge stone was later damaged or deliberately reduced in weight and became what we know as the Koh i Nur Ball 1889 233146 . Several writers have suggested it might rather be the Orlov Diamond one of the few multifaceted Mughal gems to survive gure 14.8. Although the Orlov has a similar shape to Taverniers sketch of the Great Mughals diamond accepting them as one and the same would mean that Tavernier overestimated the weight of the Great Mughals diamond by some 50 percent. A recent proponent of this theory Anna Malecka argues that Tavernier had never actually seen the Mughals diamond Malecka 2016. Tavernier also referred to seeing little Drawers full of . . . great Roses of Figure 14.9. Multifaceted diamond illustrated by Tavernier and sold by him to Louis XIV. Described by him as cut in little facets in India with computer generated thr ee dimensi onal reconstruction. 3D image Jack Ogden. 310  Diamond Cutting in India Diamonds in the royal treasury in Constantinople presumably also so called Mughal cuts Tavernier 1677 48. T he top of the Orlov has a similar facet pattern although less attenuated to the lower half of a remarkable diamond illustrated by Tavernier gure 14.9. This diamond is essentially oval with a at upper table surrounded by facets tapering down to its pointed baseessentially a multifaceted version of a brilliant cut. Is it perhaps not completely impossible that this stones arrival at the French court prompted the development of the European brilliant It was certainly cut in India before or not long after the brilliant cut rst appears in Europe. T his stone and the Orlov exhibit a combination of triangular square and attenuated facets remarkably similar to the Koh i Nur prior to its recutting in the mid nineteenth cen tury and the Nassuck Diamond prior to its recutting a generation earlier Balfour 2009 202203. A very similar style of cutting is also seen with the Great Mughals topaz illustrated and described by Tavernier almost certainly a yellow sapphire from Sri Lanka that Tavernier says was bought at Goa Ball 1889 131819 2102. Aurangzeb was annoyed that Borgio had reduced the weight of his great diamond by such a huge amount a criticism shared by Tavernier who added he was not a very accomplished cutter Ball 1889 1216. However Borgios cutting of this stone if he did indeed cut it reinforces the view that the so called Mughal cut was actually a European cut. If a European trained cutte r in India was exposed to a diamond far larger than those he generally encountered in Europe covering the surface with myriad small facets as in a rose cut would be a likely choice and of course would retain the most weight. T he large irregular blue diamond illustrated by Tavernier and sold by him to Louis XIV of France gure 14.10 the stone that eventually became the Hope Diamond has an irregular shape and lack of small facets that might be taken to separate it from the multifaceted Mughal cut. A somewhat similar form is seen with the fancy light orange pink diamond of just und er twenty ve carats in gure 14.11 that was sold at auction by Christie s of London in 1999 and is now in the al Sabah collecti on in Kuwait Haidar and Sardar 2015 244. This is also probably of seventeenth century da te. It is hard to imagine that the blocky form of Taverniers blue and perhaps that of the orange pink stone was intended to be worn like that and they may hav e been pre forms to best r eveal their quality and their potential for further cutting. It is perhaps not coincidental that both these stones are coloreda property that might not have been so obvious in their original as mined form.

His list is headed The Names of Rough stones. In addition to a standard octahedron labeled A point he shows various locally cut f lat stones the little at lasques described above. He shows a side view of a domed shape with little triangular facets that he calls a Rose stone if round but if long a Fossel. Fossel is not a term encountered in this context elsewhere and is presumably a misprint for fosset a spelling of facet we nd for example in some older English editions of Tavernier. He also depicts what appears to be a pearshaped rose labeled A Naife. T he Indian cut diamonds viewed by Europeans as being poorly cut were the diamonds from India without order or grace as described by Robert de Berquen Berquen 1669. These were the lasks or lasques the rather irregular and often thin table forms purchased by European traders as raw material for recutting. A note by Richard Hakluyt written about 1600 deals with the spices and gems traders should seek to buy in India. He refers to  Diamantes chapas which are to be bought and gaine made in working them Jones 1850 15859. Diamantes chapas was the Portuguese term for lasques. Surviving Old Indian Cuts Some older Indian cut diamonds are luckily preserved despite not appealing to European taste in the past. These dont include the historic Koh i Nur unfortunately  recut as a very disappointing shallow brilliant cut in 1852. But we do have the magnicent fancy light pink Ta viz pendant in gure 14.13 the Shah Jahah diamond which was almost certainly cut by Indian cutters Keene and Kaokji 2001 129. There is also the extraordinary Shah Diamond now in the Kremlin in Moscow Balfour 2009 25153. This elongated dia mond has a groove cut around one end so it can be a ixed to a cord and the other end engraved with the names and dates of its royal owners Nizm Shh Shah Jahan and Fath Al Shh spanning the late sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. This engraving must surely have been carried out by a series of consummate Mughal craftsman.

As late as the 1860s the London Review commented The facettes on Indian stones diamonds are rarely ground quite to a plane surface they are almost invariably rounded by the imperfect method of polishing employed 18 October 1862 338. Five years later diamond expert Harry Emanuel said In India where numbers of diamonds are still cut the work is rough and defectivethey go for weight not beauty Emanuel 1867 666. What goes around comes around. Today the majority of the diamonds sold worldwide are cut in India. It is hard to imagine that Indians had not attempted to improve the surface of some less than perfec t diamond crystals but more sophisticated cutting and polishing of diamonds may have been introduced into India from further west probably by the early 1500s. European cutters worked in India and may have been responsible for the so called Mugha l cuts. Traders such as Cholmley and Tavernier also provide ample evidence for Indian diamond cutting and these stones are found in profusion in Mughal jewelry. Their typically at irregular form however was largely scorned by the Europeans and served as raw material to export for recutting. Diamond Cutting in India  315I ndia had been the worlds primary source of diamonds since antiquity and probably Europes only source until the seventeenth century. This changed in the eighteenth century when diamonds were discovered in Brazil. This so astonished some that they refused to believe it considering it subterfuge by the Portuguese merchants. But the accounts were true and for just over a century Brazil took the c row n as the worlds major supplier of diamonds until that honor passed to South Africa.1 T he discovery of Brazilian diamonds had come at the right time. In 1813 the British mineralogist John Mawe wrote The diamond mines of India have long been declining several of 15 T he Eclipse of Indian Diamonds them are now abandoned and scarcely any of the rest contribute at present to the supply of the European market Mawe 1813 39. The impact the Brazilian diamonds had on diamond availability and use in Europe is brought into focus when it is noted that the output of Indian diamonds in the century or so prior to the discovery of the diamonds in Brazil has been estimated at anything between about 5000 and 50000 carats a year. The 1731 eet from Brazil to Portugal is supposed to have carried no less than 100000 carats two years later it was 300000. And annual Indian diamond exports do not necessarily reect annual mine output. George Watt a botanist and author of the ten volume Dictionary of the Commercial Products of India astutely remarked that the diamonds which found their way all over the civilized world from the Indian mines . . . may have largely represented the surplus accumulation of gems collected during many previous centuries Watt 188993 393. Despite the rise of Brazil and later Africa diamonds continued to be found in India and Valentine Ball 1881a 1881b discussed many working mines and discoveries in them during the nineteenth century. A large stone was found in Hyderabad in 1830. A piece was broken o  it and sold and the remaining part still weighed 305 carats. A glass cast was made of it now in the Royal Collection gure 15.1 and the original was cut and owned by the Nizam of Hyderabad. Recent studies have shown that India still probably has signicant reserves of diamonds some more than a kilometer down in the earth but as far as historical exploitation goes the early eighteenth century marks the change in focus from India to Brazil Subhash Babu et al. 2015. Brazil T here are several versions of the history of the original discovery of diamonds in Brazil. The most prevalent story is that pebbles found in the river at Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais were being used as gaming pieces or childrens playthings until they were spotted by D. Loureno de Almeida who was the provincial governor there from 1720 to 1732. De Almeida had previously been in Goa in India so he recognized these pebbles as rough diamonds and began to secretly collect them. Somehow the news got out and he had to announce his discovery to the Portuguese crown in what the historian Charles Boxer described as an ingeniously worded dispatch written in July 1729 Boxer 1962 206 Adams 1795 13435. The crown was not taken in by de Almeidas protestations that he had not recognized the little pebbles for what they were sooner and ordered him to impose taxation and limitations to working. De Almeida appears to have partly complied until 1732 when he lost his position there Boxer 1962 2058. A report that reached London in the summer of 1730 and was quoted in the Ipswich Journal may have exaggerated de Almeidas fate when it said that his Portuguese Majesty had sent a Man of War with some Oicers on Board to Brazil with order to arrest the Governor G eneral who having discovered a rich mine of Diamonds has taken out of the same to the Value of immense Sums without giving the least Notice thereof to the King  Ipswich Journal 27 June4 July 1730. T he explorer Sir Richard Burton best known for his Arabian adventures visited some of the diamond mines in Brazil in the 1860s. He refers to the discovery by de Almeida as the o icial account but notes other traditions Burton 1869 106. One was that the rst man to send diamonds back to Portugal was the pioneer Sebastiao Leme do Prado who in 1725 had found diamonds in the Rio Manso in Minas Gerais but was unable to sell them locally. Burton says the same happened to a friar Bernardino da Fonseca Lobo who supposedly found a large diamond in the Serro do Frio in Brazil. A local tradition was that the friar had also been in India and when around 1727 he saw gold miners using shiny little stones as counters in backgammon he recognized what they were collected them and headed back to Portugal. Half a century before Burton the English poet and Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  319specialist in Spanish and Portuguese history Robert Southey also mentioned Bernardino da Fonseca Lobo but says he was rewarded by being made public notary in 1734 Southey 1819 27475.

Charles Boxer has given a detailed account of the early mining in Brazil and details of the conditions security and inevitable smuggling subterfuges Boxer 1962 20425. T he Arrival of Brazilian Diamonds T he rst indication of British awareness of diamonds in Brazil seems to be a news report in October 1725 that referred to the return earlier that month of the Brazil eet to Lisbon onboard of which was 22000 Casks of Sugar and a considerable Quantity of Gold Silver and Diamonds. A report in April 1729 says that a very rich Portuguese ship coming from Brazil had been attacked and sunk by Algerian pirates who before the ship went down managed to take a Box of Diamonds. However the presence of diamonds in Brazil cannot have been widely known because when the Brazil eet returned to Lisbon in late 1729 it brought a large amount of diamonds which was considered extraordinary it having never been known that Diamonds were found there before. The mine itself was reported to be not far from Rio de Janeiro a Mine that abounds with Diamonds see also Sarmento 173132. One diamond supposedly weighed rough as it is double the weight of the biggest Diamond yet known in Europe and is sent to the Lathe to be tryd. The British press reports mirror Portuguese records that show that in the closing years of the 1720s diamonds had been reaching Lisbon with passengers arriving from Brazil Boxer 1962 206.2 In about 1730 a prospectus for the establishment of a min320  Eclipse of Indian Diamondsing and trading company for the diamonds of Serro do Frio in Minas Gerais Brazil was submitted to King Joo V of Portugal 16891750. A Joo Mendes de Almeida argued successfully against this on the basis that prots would be diverted from Portugal to foreigners including Jews from the north de Almeida ca. 1776. To start with the quantity of diamonds brought to Portugal from Brazil increased yearly. In the spring of 1732 the king of Portugal declared that all future imports of diamonds from Brazil would have to be registered and duty paid. That a signicant part of the trade was then in private hands is shown by the case of a ship arriving in Lisbon from Brazil in 1731. The captain and a passenger owners of a large Quantity of Diamonds on board were subjected to the Inquisition on pretence of their not being Christians but probably with a View to eece them of their Riches. Export from Lisbon to the rest of Europe seems to have been common. Some were sent to Holland and others to England. Indeed in the summer of 1732 there was the suggestion that the duty on diamonds imported into London from Lisbon would be raised because such import was at the expense of gold imports and prejudicial to the Nation. There was a huge clandestine trade as well of course and in 1733 some diamond merchants arriving in Lisbon were seized to help ascertain the extent of the problem. As early as January 1730 the London Evening Post reported that a great Quantity of those new Diamonds have been lately imported from Lisbon and it is thought it will lower the Price of the Oriental Diamonds very much. The quantities were indeed prodigious. One London newspaper said that not less than 100000 carats of diamonds were carried from Brazil to Portugal in 1731. By 1732 diamond prices had fallen considerably and so in 1734 the king of Portugal ordered closure of the Brazilian diamond mines in order to raise the Price and by Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  321Figure 15.2.

Fewer diamonds were then available and London diamond dealers sent Commissions to their agents at Paris Lisbon and Vienna to purchase all the Diamonds they can at any price. In mid 1735 there s eems to have been a change of heart. The Newcastle Courant for 28 June 1735 noted The Court of Portugal has oered to permit one or two Annual British Ships to sail for Brazil and import the Merchandize gold and diamonds which in Consequence will be far more advantageous to this Nation than the Assiento slave Trade which seems to be in a very dwindling Condition. Nevertheless African and other slaves continued to be a signicant part of diamond and gold mining in Brazil and Britain was keen to benet from this trade too. A 1739 petition from the Royal African Company to King George II requested the support of the British envoy at Lisbon in their negotiations to supply West African slaves to work in the gold and diamond mines in Brazil.3 Numerous depictions exist of diamond mining in Brazil particularly from the nineteenth century many showing the use and misuse of African slaves. One such is gure 15.2 a depiction of washing for diamonds in Curralhino Minas Gerais Brazil. We see slaves sitting on a bench in a shallow pond. They wash the gravel carried from the river in wooden bowls by the two gures at upper left. The seated gure on the right on the bench holds up his hands to show he has found nothing while his colleague standing in the center is showing the diamond he has just retrieved prior to putting it into the bowl on the pedestal in front of him. The standing gure in European dress who has arrived on the horse will put the found diamonds into the small bag he is holding. On the far left largely out of view in this detail is the overseer who keeps an eye on the washing. 4 Not surprisingly the Portuguese did try to play down their new discoveries in Brazil to prevent a price drop and it was reported that Tis even pretended upon the report made by several Persons of the Place where these Diamonds were found that we shall hardly have any more from thence because they were not taken out of a Mine but shed up from the Bottom of some small Rivers where they can nd no more except one in which there are some left  Daily Courant 20 March 1732. People were not fooled and in that same year Sir James Tobin a commissioner in London wrote to Major John Roach with the East India Company in Madras The diamond mine discovered Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  323in Brasille has caused an entire stagnation in the commodity Yogev 1978 111. Britain was keen to benet from the Brazil diamond trade and the British consul in Lisbon Charles Compton wrote to the Duke of Newcastle then the secretary of state for the Southern Department responsibilities included the American colonies and the Roman Catholic states of Europe in January 1732 advocating the removal of the duty on uncut diamonds in Britain to encourage the greater import of diamonds from Brazil.5 This was pursued and as noted above in March 1733 a bill was passed for the free Importation and Exportation of Diamonds Pearls Rubies Emeralds and all other Jewels and precious stones. Brazilian Diamonds Prior to the 1720s Although most of the evidence points to the late 1720s as the beginning of Brazilian diamond exports to Europe an earlier date is not impossible. Many sources particularly on the Internet now give the date of discovery as 1714 but I cannot locate the original documentation for this. An 1825 report said that the mines were rst discovered in 1681 but this is perhaps unlikely since gold was rst discovered in the Minas Gerais region in 1693 and the area was only settled to a signicant extent after about 1720. 6 However we nd diamonds imported from America listed in 1694 London customs records just a year after the discovery of gold in Minas Gerais Houghton 1727 70. Going back even further we have The Admirable Adventures and Strange Fortune of Master Antonie Knivet a detailed account by an Englishman who sailed from Plymouth in 1591 but was captured by the Portuguese and spent some time in Brazil Purchas 1625 41230. The remarkable story includes the statement In this town which he calls Menuare on the river Jawarie pre324  Eclipse of Indian Diamondssumably modern Javari . . . were found great store of gold in peeces and also Stones of Cristall and many other good stones some found diamonds and a kind of blue stones that the Portugals did esteeme of very much. We can also note that Garcia de Orta in the sixteenth century mentions that both the sixteenth century Spanish histor ian Francisco de Tamara and a Dominican friar named Domingo de Baltonas presumably D omingo de Baltans y Meja 1488ca. 1560had said that diamonds had been found in Peru although de Orta seems skeptical Markham 1913 348. In de Ortas day the Spanish viceroyalty of Peru included quite a lot of what is now Brazil. T hat the early history of diamonds from Brazil is clouded is not surprising. If some diamonds had been found in Brazil in the seventeenth century we would certainly expect this to have been kept as quiet as possible. Portugal would know only too well that any public acknowledgment of diamonds in Brazil would almost certainly have led to a price drop and also have exacerbated piracy. Even the English jeweler David Jeries writing in the mid  eighteenth centur y doubted that diamonds were coming from Brazil. He suspected that the Brazilian diamonds reaching the European market were Indian stones purchased with Brazilian gold. In support of this view he tells us that in 1734 a former governor of Fort St. George Madras told him that while stationed there he was informed that the Brazil people had long carried on a secret trade with the Indian people at Goa for Diamonds Jeries 1751 70. Harry Emanuel perhaps drawing on Je ries also noted that disbelief followed the reported discovery of diamonds in Brazil and that some stones were shipped to Goa and thence entered the trade as Indian diamond Emanuel 1867 57. T he Reverend John Adams said that the Brazilian stones were bought up in the rough state by the English and Dutch who cut them and then dispose of them all over Europe. They Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  325are neither so hard nor so clear as those of the East Indies nor do th ey sparkle so much but they are whiter. They are sold ten per cent cheaper supposing the weight to be equal Adams 1795 13435. This contradicts another account that says that the diamonds of Brazil were generally cleaner than those of the East.7 Diamonds from Elsewhere in the Americas Diamonds from other areas of the Americas probably played little if any part during our period but a few possibilities are worth noting. Among the Cecil Papers at Hateld House is a letter from Sir Walter Raleigh to Sir Robert Cecil written in November 1595 soon after Raleigh returned from his rst voyage searching for the fabled city of gold El Dorado Salisbury 1894 457. While describing Guiana now the Venezuelan region of Guayana he enthused about the diamonds to be found there I assure myself that there are not more diamonds in the East Indies than are to be found in Guiana. His exaggerations and lies about the riches of Guiana contributed to his later disgrace and execution. But was there a kernel of truth in Raleighs report Some three and a half centuries after Raleighs death signicant alluvial diamond deposits were discovered in Venezuela and total yield since then o icial and uno icial probably totals close to all the diamonds mined in India since antiquity. T here is also the report of the voyage of the French explorer Samuel Champlain in Canada in 1603 which found in Quebec Diamants in the Rockes of slate which are better than those of Alonson Purchas 1625 41611. This might well hearken back to the earlier French explorer Jacques Cartiers discovery of diamonds in Quebec in 1541they turned out to be rock crystal Cook 1993. However diamonds are indeed found in Canada and in the Quebec region. In 1577 the English priva326  Eclipse of Indian Diamondsteer Martin Frobisher returned from his second voyage even farther north in the Americas seeking a northwest passage. It was reported that the many diamonds rubies sapphires and other jewels found in this voyage were sold privately Sainsbury 1864 5560. Borneo Turning to the east there was a small but not insignicant import of diamonds from Borneo into Europe particularly around 161020 Ogden 2005. Some knowledge of Borneo in the West can probably be dated back to the geographer Ptolemy around AD 150 and in medieval times European travelers such as Marco Polo in the late thirteenth century and Friar Odoric of Porderone a generation later mentioned Borneo but make no mention of diamonds. The rst unambiguous European mention of Borneo diamonds comes from the Portuguese traveler and writer Ferno Lopes de Castanheda 15001559 who describes diamonds from Tania Pura the old capital of Borneo. T hen Caesar Fredericke a merchant from Venice who traveled to the East Indies and beyond in the second half of the sixteenth century noted that naturally pointed diamonds came from Java and were weightier than the Indian stones Hakluyt 1599 372. One of the rst actions of the East India Company after its foundation in 1600 was to translate into English a report written by the Dutch merchant Jan Huyghen van Linschoten who had traveled to the East Indies in the 1580s that described the diamonds to be obtained in the region Burnell and Tiele 1885 1112. By Borneo Linschoten tells us was the straight called Tania Pura . . . where many diamonds are found that are excellent they are small but very good and heavier which is good for the seller but not for the buyer Burnell and Tiele 1885 Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  327213738. He added Sometimes they nd Diamonds of one hundred and two hundred Mangelyns the Mangelin weight varied depending on time and place from around a carat to almost two carats and more but very few. Another document survives seemingly translated from a Dutch letter that says From Sukadana in Borneo is to be procured the best diamonds in the world Danvers 1896 79. T he East India Company moved quickly and in their rst voyage established a trading factory at Bantam on the island of Java in 1602. On 4 December 1608 John Saris chief factor there wrote to the East India Company in London I have many times certied your worships of the trade the Flemings follow to Sukadana which place yieldeth great store of diamonds and of their manner of dealing with them Danvers 1896 22 see also Sainsbury 1862 178. The Dutch he explained bartered the diamonds at Sukadana with gold from Banjarmasin also in Borneo or the blue glass beads which the Chinese make. Saris proposed that similar blue beads could be made cheaply in England but in any case the company should enter the diamond trade and would surely make its prots when the diamonds were nally sold in Europe. The English sent a jeweler to Borneo Hugh Greet who as noted in the East India Company records went out a very poor man much indebted carried himself very mutinously debauchedly and unfaithfully gave away 1000 riyals belonging to the company employed the companys moneys to his own use when he bought diamonds for the Company reserved the choicest for himself Sainsbury 1884 387. Nevertheless despite the many and thoroughly documented shortcomings of Greet and his successors diamonds from Borneo began to be dispatched to London from 1614 Ogden 2005. The problems encompassed the incompetence of the English agents lack of capital competition climate and even headhunters and by the early 1620s the ow of 328  Eclipse of Indian Diamondsdiamonds from Borneo to England had almost ceased. English eyes were now on Indian diamonds. The Dutch continued in the trade and indeed while in India Jean Baptiste T avernier was sent six diamonds of three or four carats each from Borneo by the Dutch General Vandime Ball 1889 26768. These were sent to Tavernier to see if he could test the generals belief that the Borneo diamonds were softer than the Indian. As Tavernier noted the belief was unfounded. T here seems no evidence that diamonds were being cut in Borneo or elsewhere in southeast Asia in the seventeenth century. Tavernier recounts how he was shown a dagger by the king of Bantam in Java the top of the hilt of which was set with large faceted diamonds that had been cut in Goa Ball 1889 227679. The rest of the hilt and the sheath were covered in empty settings. The king asked Tavernier to nd diamonds to f it. Tavernier explained that it was normal to make the setting to t existing diamonds and that the only option was to nd diamonds at Goa Golconda or the Indian diamond mines that could possibly be cut to t. Hubert Bari has suggested that the abundant rose cut diamonds se t in the Lombok Treasure from Indonesia were diamonds brought there by the Dutch cut in Antwerp Bari and Sautter 2001 96101. Certainly the diamonds in this treasure look more European than Indian cut but the extent of the Europe southeast Asia t rade in rose diamonds in the seventeenth century is unclear. The majority of the diamond set o bjects in the Lombok Treasure would seem to be later than the seventeenth century. T he East India Companys involvement in the Borneo diamond trade at the beginning of the seventeenth century had lasted barely ten years but it could be argued that it provided the company with the experience it needed to become a lead player in the exploitation of the diamonds from India and helped to establish London as the world center for the diamond trade. Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  329Africa From the mid nineteenth century Africa has been a major source of diamonds. Initially there were discoveries in South Africa but over succeeding decades diamonds were found also in what are now Namibia Botswana Zimbabwe the Congo Angola Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Earlier knowledge of diamonds in Africa is not impossible. The Portuguese were active in Angola as early as the fteenth century and from 1749 we have the comment that the discoveries made by the Portuguese in this century in the Brazils and the Kingdom of Angola prove that other countries are enriched with that valuable treasure diamonds in the bowels of the earth. Though it is commonly allowed that these later works do not produce such good stones as those which are found in the East India Anon 1749. Perhaps more information about early awareness of Angolan diamonds can be found in Portuguese archives. Central Asia In 1734 it was reported that diamonds and gold had been discovered in the Southern Parts of Russia towards Persia and the Moguls Country. 8 Whether this was accurate or optimistic is uncertain but we can note that both diamonds and gold are now known from Kazakhstan. There are persistent rumors of small bright diamonds being found in parts of what is now Pakistan. Some confusion with the bright rock crystal from Balochistan sometimes sold as diamond quartz Pakimer diamonds or Bolochistan diamonds is likely but some still insist that the occasional true diamond is found. 330  Eclipse of Indian DiamondsIndian Diamonds After 1730 Despite the rise of Brazil some diamonds continued to reach Europe from India through the rest of the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth. The British East India Company lost its monopoly in 1694 but merged with the competing English Company Trading to the East Indies in 1708 and became the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies. A document a detail of which is shown in gure 15.3 dated 1756 is from a license from the United Company to the merchant Joseph Salvador to transport coral as beads and rough to Fort St. George and the proceeds to be invested in Pearls Diamonds Diamond Boart and other precious Stones or Jewels and in no other Goods whatsoever. These goods were to be transported back to London on one or more of the United Companys ships to be Sold at the said Companys Candle an auction timed by the burning of a certain length of candle. From the later seventeenth century to the nineteenth century many of the famous Indian stones reached the west including the Pigot the Agra the Idols Eye the Nassak the Arcots and the Koh i Nur. Some such as the Pigo t were obtained by senior personages in India not infrequently in less than clear circumstances while others such as the Arcots were more in the nature of bribes by local rulers hoping to retain or garner the support of British royalty Ogden 2009 Ogden 2013 38081. King George III and his wife Queen Charlotte faced signicant criticism for the quantity of diamonds they received in this manner and were the subject of some vicious satire in the press. T he hand colored etching in  gure 15.4 dated 1788 shows the king and queen along with Warren Hastings the rst governor general of Benga l and Edward Thurlow the lord chancellor of Great Britain as a demon. Hastings pours diamonds into the royal mouths from a bag inscribed Indian Plunder.9 Eclipse of Indian Diamonds  331Figure 15.3.  above  Detail of a license for Joseph Salvador to trade for diamonds in India 1756.

But by then India was being eclipsed by the vast diamond riches of Brazil. Some diamonds may well have found their way from Brazil to Europe prior to 1725 and there were also some diamonds from Borneo but the huge inux of diamonds from Brazil coinciding with the growing popularity of the brilliant cut had a profound and lasting e ect on European jewelry. The wealth generatin g Industrial Revolution created a perfect market for the stones. Then little more than a century later diamonds were discovered in South Africa. These soon came on the markets in even greater numbers than had the Brazil stones. A price crash was to be expected but with serendipitous timing the vast new wealth being created in the United States was soon ready to absorb them.This page intentionally left blank T his book has taken the reader on a long journey from the diamond chips used by lapidaries ve hundred years or more before the birth of Christ to the arrival of diamonds from Brazil more than two millennia later. Through this period there was a gradual change in the understanding of diamonds from myth and legend to science and for the nal centuries of this period the discovery and remarkably rapid development of diamond cutting. However unique and specialized diamond cutting was it ts within the general context of the technological development that marked the change from medieval to Renaissance Europe. Diamond history has also mirrored the history of trade in general and Epilogue the people and peoples involved in it. By Roman times overland and coastal sea trade was supplemented by the direct route across the Indian Ocean. Fifteen hundred years later the opening up of sea lanes from Europe to India and to the newly discovered Americas ushered in two new periods in diamonds history. The Indian sea trade tied to the rise of the European trading companies in Asia greatly increased the use of diamonds in European jewelry the transatlantic trade a century later brought Brazils diamond wealth to European markets. T here is much still to explore. There are many European archives to scour and the non Europe an sourcesArmenian Arabic Persian and Indianwill help to redress the inevitable Eurocentric bias of this book. We long to know more of the many non Europeans who pla yed an essential role in the diamond trade in India such as the Banian diamond dealer Vogjee Moodasee who worked with Cholmley and Mir Muhammad Sayyid who arrived in Golconda as a horse dealer in about 1590 became a diamond merchant farmed mines at Kollur in 335the 1630s and then rose to high political power Subrahmanyam 1988. A history of diamonds is also a history of jewelry. Diamonds of any signicant size have always taken pride of place in ornament whether expressing rank or faith or constancy. Smaller diamonds have served typically as accompaniments for larger gems whether anking the pink sapphire in one of the earliest surviving diamond ringsthat from A Khanoum in what is now Afghanistan gure 2.1or providing the bright little sparks in Renaissance jewelry. As early as medieval times the use in Europe of diamonds in rings apparently associated with love provides a wonderful historic tradition for modern practice. De Beers half century old slogan A diamond is forev er may be modern marketing hyperbole but there seems to be no end of fascination with this king of gems. 336  EpilogueA Description of the Diamond Mines was published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London the worlds rst scientic journal in 1677 Cholmley 1677. It was subsequently also published in Miscellanea Curiosa Containing a collection of Curious Travels Voyages and Natural Histories of Countries As they have been Delivered in to the Royal Society vol. 3 1707 printed by W.B. f or James and Je ery Wale London pp. 238 55. T he handwritten draft dated 1675 survives in the British Library Egerton MS 2543 22429 and apart from some minor spelling variations mainly in the place names tidying up of grammar and the presence of a date it is the same as the published text. The inscription supposedly left at the Currure mine by a Portuguese diamond miner who struck riches there at the last moment is omitted in the handwritten draft but space is left for it. Appendix A 1675 Description of the Diamond Mines B y  P ro BAB ly nA t HA ni E l cH olml E y Despite being unsigned the assumption is that the report was written by Nathaniel Cholmley. Nathaniel Cholmley had been in India since 1663 settled in Machilipatnam the main port in the kingdom of Golconda. He traded in diamonds a business that was not then engaged in by the East India Company. Nathaniel encountered various problems with the company in the mid 1660s that includ ed his arrest but with his brothers and friends help he was allowed to stay in India and trade in diamonds. In 1670 with the arrival of Sir William Langhorne as the new governor his status improved and in 1674 the company gave approval for him to settle at Golconda by reason of his skill in dyamonds and to transact business there but still not actually acting as an agent. From various East India Company documents we can establish that he was at Machilipatnam in about early September 1675 when he was extremely ill and even tried to kill himself in a fever Fawcett 1952 277. He was in Navarazpuram where he had built a house in late September 1675 quite recovered and on 5 November 1675 he was reported to be at the diamond mines and as healthy as he had ever been. He had returned to Machilipatnam by the end of 1675 having completed his business for that year. Thus the reports stated 337time and placeMunnemurg a diamond mining area some 50 miles south of Kurnool 27 November 1675 is consistent with the author being Cholmley besides few other Englishmen would have had the f irsthand experience of the mines necessary to compile it. 1 T he writer is careful not to imply that he had visited all the mines himself. The facts he gives about the Golconda mines are based on experience of several of the place I have seen and the best Informations I could meet with. He provides more cursory information about the Bisapore Bijapur modern Vijayapur mines and it is possible he had not visited these himself. Ball in his commentary on Tavernier noted the Philosophical Transactions article and provided much information about the mines including comparing and attempting to identify the mines listed by Tavernier and the anonymous writer who he also presumed to be Nathaniel Cholmley Ball 1889 2352n.

But leaving the description of other places to those that know them better I shall only keep my self to the Coast of Coromandel with which I am acquainted and having visited several of its Mines am able to say something thereof Experimentally. T he Diamond Mines in these parts a re generally adjacent to Rocky 338  AppendixHills or Mountains whereof begins a great Ledge or Range near Cape Comorin extending in breadth about 50 English miles some conjoyning others scatterd and running thence in length quite through Bengala. In among and near these Hills in several places are known to be as its believed most of them have Mines many of them are possessed by petty Princes or Rajaes of the Hundues some driven thither shelter by the Mores who have taken the greatest part of their Country from them others never overcome as the Rajaes on the Hills and in and near Bengala who admit of little or no Commerce with their Neighbours or passage thro ugh their country which being barren in few places a ording good water the ways craggy and very toylsom especially to an army the Moors covet not but let them enjoy it peaceably yet to prevent danger they forbid digging as the King of Pegu does or dig some few Mines only very privately so that a great part of the Mines are unsearched and concealed. But the Kingdoms of Golconda and Visiapore contain in them scope enough of ground known to have Mines su icient to furnish all the world plentiful ly with Diamonds but their Kings permit digging only in some places appointed lest as it is imagined they should become too common and withal fear of tempting the threatening greatness of Aurengzebe forbidding also those places that a ord the largest Stones or else keeping workmen in them for their own private uses So that but a very small quantity in comparison of what might be and those only of ordinary size are found. In the Kingdom of Golconda as near as I can gather from the best aquainted are 23 Mines now employed or have been so lately Viz. Quolure Codawillicul Malabar Buttephalem Ramiah Gurem Muttampellee Currure Ganjeeconeta Luttawaar Jonagerree Pirai Dugullee Purwillee Anuntapellee Girregeta Maarmood Wazzergerree Munnemurg Langumboot Whootoor Muddemurg and Melwillee or the New Mine. Quolure was the rst Mine made use of in this Kingdom. The Earth is something yellowish not unlike the colour of our gravel dried but Appendix  339whiter in some places where it bounds with smooth pebbles much like some of those that come out of our Grave pits in England. They use to nd great quantities in the Vein if it may properly be so called the Diamonds not lying in continued Clusters as some imagine but frequently so very scattering that sometimes in the space of 14 of an Acres of ground digged between two or three fathoms deep there hath been nothing found especially in the Mines that aord great Stones lying near the supercies of the Earth and about thr ee fathoms deep deeper they could not dig for water it being in a Vale near a River. In other places the Earth is mixt with rugged Stones where they seldom mine deeper though in higher ground before the colour of the Earth alters and the Vein ceases which they give a guess at by the small Stones they nd in the Earth the principal guide they have in the discovery of the Mines. T he Diamonds found in these Mines are generally well shaped many of them pointed and of a good lively white water but it also produces some yellow ones some brown and of other Colours. They are of ordinary sizes from about six in a Mangelin of which they nd but few to ve or six Mangelins each some of 10 15 20 they nd but rarely. They have frequently a bright transparent skin inclining to a greenish colour though the heart of the Stone be purely white but the veins of these Mines are almost worn out. T he Mines of Codawillikul Malabar and Buttepallem consist of a reddish Earth inclining to an orange colour with which it stains the clothes of the labourers that work in it they dig about four fathom deep. They a ord Stones generally of an excellent w ater and crystalline skin smaller sizes than those of Quolure Ramiah Gurem and Muttempellee have a yellowish Earth like Quolure their Stones like those of the two former Mines but mixt with many of a blew water. T hese ve Mines being under the same Government with Melwillee where the Governour resides He to draw the Adventures and Mer A Mangelin is four grains in weight saith Linschoten. 340  Appendixchants near him that he may be better informed of the actions and advantages and know the better how to eece them the general practice of Governours in these parts has very lately forbid their use and commanded all to repair to his Residence which they must obey or f lie into another Government. T he next Mine in our way is Currure the most famous of them all and most ancient. It has been under subjection of the King of Golconda but about 25 years taken with the Country of Karnaticum from the Hendue Rajaes ab out that time by the Nabob Meer Jumla. In it have been found Diamonds of a seize weight which is about 9 ounces Troy or 8112 Pagos weight. It is only employed by the King for his own private use The Diamonds that are found in it are very well spread large Stones it yields few or none small they have generally a bright skin which inclines to a pale greenish colour but within are purely white. The Soyl is reddish as many of the others. About sixty or seventy years ago when it was under the Government of the Hundues and several persons permitted to adventure in digging a Portugeez Gentleman went thither from Goa and having spent in Mining a great sum of money to the amounts of 100000 Pagos as tis reported and converted every thing he bought with him that would fetch any money even to what wearing clothes he could spare while the Miners were at work for the last days expence he had prepared a cup of Poyson resolving if that night he found nothing to drink his last with the conclusion of his money but in the Evening the Workmen brought him a very fair Spread Stone of 20 Pagos weight in commemoration whereof he caused a great Stone to be erected in the place with an inscription engraven on it in the Hundues or Telling a Tongue to the following e ect which remains to be seen to this day Your Wife and children sell sell what you have Spare not your Clothes nay make your self a Slave But money get then to currur E make hast T he re search the Mines a prize youl nd at last Appendix  341After which he immediately returned with his Stone to Goa. Not far from Currure are the Mines of Lattawaar and Ganjeeconta which are in the same Soyl as Currure and a ord Stones not unlike But Lattawaar hath many representing the great end of a Razor blade thin on one s ide and thick on the other very white and of an excellent water but the best of the Mine is worn out and Ganjeeconta employed only to the Kings private use. Jonagerre Pirai Dugulle Purwillee and Anuntapellee consist also of Red earth are now employed and a ord many large Stones part of them a greenish water but the most absolute Mines are of Wazzergerre and Munnemurg the other rather representing Pits than Mines for there they sink through high Rocks till they go far below their basis that they can go no further for water in some places 40 or 50 fathom deep. The supercies of the Rocks consist of hard rm white Stone into which they cut a Pit like a Well of about 4 and 5 in some places 6 foot deep before they come to a crust of a mineral Stone like the Mineral of Iron when they ll the Hole with Wood and keep as hot re as they can there for 2 or 3 days till they think it su iciently heated then they pour  in wate r till they have quencht it which also f lakes and mollies both Stone and Mineral both being cold they dig again take out all the crumbled stu  and dig up what they can besides before they heat at anew the crust seldom is thicker than 3 or 4 foot which creasing they come to a vein of Earth that usually runs under the Rock 2 or 3 furlongs sometimes much further This they dig all out and search and if their rst attempt prove successful they go to work again digging after the same manner as deep as they can till they come to water for the drawing whereof wanting the help of Engins known in Europe they can go no deeper although the Vein lie lower all lumps of the Mineral they break in pieces and frequently f ind Diamonds enclosed in them. To work on these Mines is very expensive but the advantage is commonly answerable yet in respect of the certain disburse that must be before any thing be found they are 342  Appendixnot so much frequented as others where they may try their fortunes with a smaller stock. The Earth they dig out is red Many large Stones are found here the smallest about 6 in a mangelleen. They are mixt waters but the greatest part good only of ill avoured shap es many cragged pieces of stones some as if they had been parts of very great ones others with pieces broken o  them yet I never heard of any that found two seeming fellows although they do those that look as if they had been newly broken. In Langumboot they dig as they do at Wazzergerrec and Munnemurg the Rock is not altogether so solid but the Earth and Stones it produces much alike. Wootoor should have been placed next to Currure it lying near it and aording Stones of a like magnitude shapes and waters tis employed only to the Kings use And singular in that its Diamonds are found in black Earth. Muddemurg far exceeds all the rest for Diamonds of a delicate shape water and bright transparent skin proud as it were in discovering their inward beauties with which no other Mine can compare yet it has also store of Veiny ones but those likewise of so curio us shape and water that is di icult to discover than from the good especially the small ones. It produces Stones or divers magnitudes from 10 and 12 in a mangalleen to 6 or 7 magelleens  sic  each and besides some great ones. The Earth is red but its seated in the Woods and the water so bad that to all except the people bred there it presently occasions Feavers  destroys abundance in so much that most of the Adventurers have forsaken it notwithstanding which it hath been more protable than any of the rest the Vein frequently lying near the superf icies of the Earth seldom running deep and is better furnisht than any other yet discoverd. The River Kishna of excellent waters is but 9 miles distant but the Miners or Merchants are either poor that they cannot or else over awed by the Governour pretend to be and dare not be at the charges of fetching their water from thence. Divers are of Appendix  343opinion that besides the Water the Town lying in a bottom environd with Hills and Morass adjoyning the Air may have been infected and contribute to its unhealthfulness. Melwillee or the New Mine so called because it was but lately found out or at least permitted to be made use of in the year 1670 it had then a year employed the Miners but it was forbidden and lay unoccupied till 1673 when complaint being made at Couleur that the Vein was worn out the King again licensed its settlement. The Earth they mine in is very red and many of the Stones found there have of it sticking to them as if it had clung there while they were of a soft glutinous substance and had not attained their hardness maintaining its colour on its skin seeming to be roughned with it that it cannot be fetcht out by grinding on a rough Stone with sand which they make use of to clean them. The Stones are generally well shaped their size from 5 or 6 in a mangelleen to those of 14 or 15 each and some bigger but greatest quantities of the middle sorts Most of them have a thick dull skin incline to a yellowish water not altogether so strong  lively as of the other Mines very few of them of a crystallin water  skin. They are reported to be apt to aw in splitting which occasions these people to esteem them something softer than the product of many of the other Mines several that atter by their seeming whiteness when rough discover their deceitfulness having passed the Mill and too often a yellowish tincture to the disappointment and loss of them that have cut them but what they want in goodness is in part supplied by the plenty they nd which together with their properties make them the cheaper. This being what I have gathered both by experience of several of the place I have seen and the best Informations I could meet with of the Mines in this Kingdom I shall now proceed to those in Visiapore. Visiapore is known to contain Mines enclosing Stones as large and good as those of Golconda but the King for reasons already given makes use but of the meanest whereby as Golconda is famous for the largeness of those it aords Visiapore is noted for the smallest whose 344  AppendixMines though they seldom or never render an Adventurer a fortune or estate at once as sometimes those of Golconda do by a great Stone or several found together yet they are more populous and better employed the small Stones lying thicker in the earth so that the generality are gainers and few but that get their expence whereas those of Golconda dig away a considerable Estate and nd nothing others not their charges and where one is a gainer divers lose. T here are 15 Mines employed in the Kingdom of Visiapore viz Ramulconeta Banugunapellee Pendekull Moodawarum Cumerwillee Paulkull Workull Lungeepoleur Pootloor Punchelingull Shingarrampent Tonarpaar Gundepellee Donee and Gazerpellee. In Ramulconeta Mines in red Earth about 15 or 16 foot deep they seldom nd a Diamond of a mangelleen weight but small to 20 or 30 in a mangelleen. They are generally of an excellent crystalline water have a bright clear skin inclining frequently to a pale greenish colour are well shaped but few of them pointed ones. There are also found amongst them several broken pieces of Diamonds by the Country people called Shemboes. In Banugunnapellee Pendekull and Moodawarum they dig as at Ramulconeta and in the same kind of Earth they also a ord Stones much alike being neighbouring places. Cummerwillee Panukull and Workull are not far distant produce Stones much alike out of the same coloured Earth but very small ones even to a 100 in a mangelleen. Lungepoleur Mines are of a yellowish Earth like those of Quoleur its Diamonds are generally well shaped globular few pointed of a very good crystalline water and bright skins many of them have a thick dark grass green skin some spo tted also with black that they seem all foul yet are not so but within purely white and clean. Their sizes are from 2 or 3 mangelleens downwards but few very small. Pootloor Mines are of reddish Earth but a ord Stones much like those of Lungepoleur only smaller under a mangelleen the general sizes are of 12 13 14 16 of a mangelleen. Appendix  345Punchelingull Shringarrampent and Tondarpaar are also of red Earth their Diamonds not unlike those of Quoleur only rarely or never any large ones are found there. Gundepellee hath the fame Earth with the former and produces Stones of equal magnitude but frequently of a pure crystalline water wherein they exceed the former. Donee and Gazerpellee dig both in red Earth likewise and a ord Stones alike the greatest part whereof are of good shapes and waters. T hey have also many Shemboes and some of bad waters. Some brown which these people call soft or weak waterd being esteemed of a softer and weaker body than others by reason they have not so much life when cut and are subject to aw in splitting and on the Mill their general product is in Stones of middle sizes But Gazerpellee has besides many large ones and is the only Mine noted for such in the Kingdom of Vijiapore. With which concluding the description of the Mines I shall give some account how the Diamonds are found and how they handle the Earth to nd them which is as followeth T he Diamonds are so scattered and dispersed in the Earth and lie so thin that in the most plentiful Mines its rare to nd one in digging or till they have prepared the stu  and do search purposely for them T hey are also frequently enclosd in Clods and some of those of Melwillee the New Mine in the Kingdom of Golconda have the Earth to f ix about them that till they grind them on a rough Stone with sand they cannot move it suiciently to discover they are transparent or were it not for their shapes to know them from other Stones. At the f irst opening of the Mine the unskilful Labourers sometimes to try what they have found lay them on a great Stone and striking on them with another to their costly experience discover they had broken a Diamond. One I knew had an excellent Stone of 8 magelleens  sic  served so by ignorant Miners he employed. Near the place where they dig they raise a Wall with such rugged Stones as they nd at hand whereof all the Mines a ord plenty of 346  Appendixabout 2 foot high and six foot over ooring it well with the fame for the laying of which they have no other Mortar than the Earth tampered with Water. To strengthen and make it tight they throw up a bank against the side of it In one whereof they leave a small vent about two inches from the bottom by which it empties itself into a little pit made in the earth to receive small Stones if by chance any should run through. The vent being stopped they ll the Cistern they have made with water soaking therein as much of the Earth they dig out of the Mines as it can conveniently receive at a time breaking the clods picking out the great stones and stirring it out with shovels till the water is all muddy the gravely stu  falling to the bottom then they open the vent letting out the foul water and supplying it with clean till all the Earthy substance be wasted away and none but a gravely remains at the bottom. Thus they continue washing till about 10 of the Clock before Noon when they take the gravely stu  they have washed and spread it on a place made plain and smooth like a Bowling alley for the purpos e near the Cistern which being soon dried by the heat of the Sun at that time of the day they very curiously look it over that the smallest bit of a stone can hardly escape them. They never examine the stu  they have washt but between the hours of ten and three least any cloud by interposing intercept the brisk beams of the Sun which they hold very necessary to assist them in their search the Diamonds not forbearing to reect them when they touch therein rendring themselves thereby the more conspicuous. Some of the expertest Labourers are employed in searching he that sets them at work usually sitting by and looking but its hardly possible especially where many are employed to watch them so narrowly but that they may steal part of what they nd as many times some of them do and selling it privately convert to their own life. If they nd a large Stone they carry it not presently to their Employer but keep on looking having an eye on him till they observe he takes notice of it when with a turn of their hand they give him a glimpse of it but deAppendix  347liver it not till they have done work and then very privately it being the general endeavour to conceal what they nd least it should come to the knowledge of the Governour of the place and he require a share which in the Kingdom of Golconda is usually practiced without respect to any agreement made with them. T he Miners those that employ them and the Merchants that buy the Stones of them are generally Ethnicks not a Mussleman that ever I heard of followed the employment. These Labourers and their Employers are Tellingas commonly Natives of or near the place. The Merchants are the Banians of Guzzarat who for some Generations have forsaken their own Country to take up the Trade in which they have had such success that tis now solely engrossd by them who corresponding with their Country men in Surrat Goa Golconda Vijiapore Agra and Dillee and other places in India furnish them all with Diamonds. T he Governours of the Mines are also Idolaters In the King of Golcondas Dominions a Tellinga Brammee rents most of them whose agreement with the Adventurer is that all the Stones they nd under a Pagoda weight are to be their own all of that weight and above it to be his for the Kings use But although this Agreement be signed and sealed unto he minds not at all the performance thereof but endeavours to engross all the prot to himself by tyrannical squeezing both Merchant  Miners whom he not only taxes very high but maintaining Spies among them of their own people on the least inkling that they have been any ways fortunate he immediately makes a demand on them and raises their Tax else on a false pretence they have found a great Stone drubs them till they surrender what they have to redeem their bodies from torment. Besides the Excise is so high on all sorts of Provisions Beetle and Tabacco which to them is as absolutely necessary as Meat or at least in their esteem that it is thereby raised to  A Pagoda weighs 9 mangelleens. 348  Appendixdouble that price they bear without the Government and it is furnisht only by some Licensd persons if any other should endeavour to bring in the least quantity by stealth he is ned even for one leaf of Tobacco if it be person of any repute or worth any thing else severly drubd for it by which course there is hardly a man worth 500l to be found amongst them most of them dealing by Moneys taken up at Interest of Usurers who reside there purposely to furnish them who with the Governour eat up their gains for that one would wonder any of them should stay and not betake themselves to place where they might have better usage as there are several in other Governments and some few that have the sense to remove but many their Debts others hopes of a great hit detains. Both Merchant and Miner go generally naked only a porr Clout about their middle and a Shash on their heads they dare not wear a Coat lest the Governour should say they have thriven so much are rich and so inlarge his Diamonds on them. The wisest when they nd a great Stone conceal it till they have an opportunity and then with Wife and Children run all away into the Visiapore Country where they are secure. T he Government in the Visiapores Country is better their Agreement observed. Taxes easier and no such impositions on provisions the Merchants go handsomely clad amongst whom are several persons of considerable Estates which they are permitted to enjoy peaceably by reason whereof their Mines are much more populous and better employed than those of Golconda. It is observable that notwithstanding the Agreement with the Adventurers of the Mines that all Stones above a certain weight shall be for the Kings use yet in the Metropolis of either Kingdom as the Cities of Golconda and Visiapore are there is no seizure all Stones are free and the late deceased King Abdull Cutopshaw of the former and Edelshaw of the latter would not only give very great prizes for large Stones but richly vest and present the Merchant that sold them with Horses or something else of value thereby encouraging others Appendix  349to bring the like. But the present King of Visiapore is a Child and the King of Golcondas delights solely pleaded on light Women dancers and Tricksh ewers that he neither minds Diamonds nor many things more necessary committing the Government of his Kingdom to a Tellinga Braminee which the Mussleman not well resenting does in some measure threaten the stability of his State. The most famous type of diamond cut is the round brilliant cut. It is known for its ability to maximize a diamonds sparkle and brilliance due to its precise faceting. Diamond certification is a process in which a diamond is evaluated and graded based on its characteristics such as carat weight cut color and clarity known as the 4Cs. This evaluation is conducted by a reputable gemological laboratory such as the Gemological Institute of America GIA or the International Gemological Institute IGI. A certificate detailing these characteristics is provided to verify the diamonds quality and authenticity. The diamond industry is vast and there isnt one definitive top diamond dealer globally. However some of the largest and most wellknown diamond companies include De Beers Alrosa and Rio Tinto. These companies are known for their extensive involvement in diamond mining and trade. Diamond impurities or inclusions are natural features within a diamond that can affect its clarity. Signs of diamond impurities include internal flaws such as feathers crystals or needles. Surface blemishes may include pits or scratches. These imperfections are often evaluated and rated on a clarity scale ranging from Flawless to Included. Blood diamonds also known as conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance armed conflict against governments. The term gained widespread awareness due to humanitarian concerns related to unethical mining practices and exploitation. Efforts such as the Kimberley Process have been established to prevent the trade of conflict diamonds. The diamond industry has a long and storied history. Diamonds were first discovered and mined in India around the 4th century BCE. The industry expanded with the discovery of diamond deposits in South Africa in the late 1800s which led to the establishment of large diamond mining companies like De Beers. Today diamonds are sourced from various regions worldwide including Russia Australia and Canada. Major players in the diamond market include companies involved in diamond mining trading and retailing. De Beers Alrosa and Rio Tinto are some of the leading diamond mining companies. In terms of retail companies like Tiffany  Co. Cartier and Graff Diamonds are wellknown luxury brands in the diamond jewelry market. The number of diamonds used in highend jewelry can vary depending on the design and size of the piece. For example a solitaire engagement ring may feature a single prominent diamond while a necklace or bracelet might include multiple smaller diamonds set in intricate patterns. Highend jewelry pieces often focus on quality and artistry with diamonds chosen for their exceptional cut clarity color and carat weight. Langsmith is likely a reference to an expert or resource specializing in diamond appraisals. An expert like Langsmith can teach us how to evaluate diamonds based on the 4Cs carat cut color and clarity how to identify diamond treatments or enhancements and how to properly assess the value of a diamond. They may also provide guidance on recognizing reputable grading certificates and authenticating diamonds.
